[["V","Manicūla Sutta：In the royal palace at Rājagaha，the report once arose among the retinue that Sākyan recluses were allowed to take gold and silver．The headman Manicūlaka，who was present，denied this，but，being unable to convince his audience，he sought the Buddha，who assured him that these monks were allowed neither to seek nor to accept gold and silver．S．iv．325f．； cp．Vin．ii．296f．"]]
