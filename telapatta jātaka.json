[["V","Telapatta Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once the youngest of one hundred sons of the king of Benares．He heard from the Pacceka Buddhas，who took their meals in the palace，that he would become king of Takkasilā if he could reach it without falling a prey to the ogresses who waylaid travellers in the forest．Thereupon，he set out with five of his brothers who wished to accompany him．On the way through the forest the five in succession succumbed to the charms of the ogresses，and were devoured．One ogress followed the Bodhisatta right up to the gates of Takkasilā，where the king took her into the palace，paying no heed to the Bodhisatta’s warning．The king succumbed to her wiles，and，during the night，the king and all the inhabitants of the palace were eaten by the ogress and her companions．The people，realising the sagacity and strength of will of the Bodhisatta，made him their king．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to the Janapada-Kalyāni Sutta （q．v．）．The monks said it must be very hard not to look at a janapada-kalyāni，but the Buddha denied this and related the above story （J．i．393ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Jātaka seems also to have been called the Takkasilā Jātaka （J．i．470）．"]]
