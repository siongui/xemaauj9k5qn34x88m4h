[["V","Uttareyyadāyaka Thera：An arahant．In Padumuttara’s time he was a learned brahmin of Hamsavatī．One day，when going to bathe with his pupils，he saw the Buddha and gave him his upper garment （uttarīya）．The garment remained in the sky，forming a canopy over the Buddha and his monks．As a result，for thirty thousand kappas，Uttareyyadāyaka was born in the deva-worlds，and fifty times he became king of the gods．On thirty-six occasions he was king of men．Everywhere he went a canopy of fine material appeared over him and he obtained all he wished for．Ap．i．272-3．\t"]]
