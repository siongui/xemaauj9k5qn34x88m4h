[["V","Kālingabodhi Jātaka：The Kālinga king of Dantapura had two sons，Mahā Kālinga and Culla Kālinga．Soothsayers foretold that the younger would be an ascetic，but that his son would be aCakka-vatti．Knowing of this prophecy，Culla Kālinga became so arrogant that Mahā Kālinga，on coming to the throne，ordered his arrest．But Culla Kālinga fled to Himavā and lived there as an ascetic．Near his hermitage lived the king and queen of Madda who had fled with their daughter from their city of Sāgala．Soothsayers had predicted that the princess’s son would be a Cakka-vatti，and all the kings of Jambudīpa sought her hand．Her parents，not wishing to incur the enmity of any of the kings，fled with her from the city．One day a wreath of mango-flowers which the princess dropped into the river was picked up by Culla Kālinga，who thereupon went in search of her．With her parents’ consent he married her，and to these two was born a son whom they called Kālinga．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the stars revealed that Mahā Kālinga had died，Kālinga was sent to Dantapura，to a courtier who had been an ally of Culla Kālinga．The prince’s identity having been duly established，he was crowned king，and his chaplain，Kālinga-bhāradvāja，taught him the duties of a Cakka-vatti．On the fifteenth day after his coronation，the tokens of a Cakka-vatti king appeared before him．（For details see J．iv．232）．One day while riding through the air with his retinue，he came to the Bodhi-tree under which Buddhas attain Enlightenment，and though he prodded his elephant until it died the animal found it impossible to fly over the spot．The royal chaplain investigated matters and reported his finding to the king who，having learnt from the chaplain of a Buddha’s virtues，paid great honour to the tree for seven days．See also Samanakolañña．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKālinga is identified with Ananda and Kālinga-bhāradvāja with the Bodhisatta．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to the Bodhi-tree planted，at Ananda’s suggestion，by Anāthapindika，at the entrance to Jetavana，in order that people might worship it while the Buddha was away on tour．As soon as a seedling was planted from the great Bodhi-tree at Gayā，it grew into a tree fifty cubits high，and the Buddha consecrated it by spending one night under it，wrapt in meditation （J．iv．228-36）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kālingabodhi Jātaka is found also in theMahābodhi-vamsa （Mbv．62ff ）； there it is given in much greater detail and differs in minor details from the Jātaka version，containing，among other things，a long description of dibba-cakkhu and the seven gems of a Cakka-vatti．"]]
