[["V","Phandana Jātaka：A lion acquired the habit of going to lie under a phandana tree，but one day a branch fell on his shoulder and hurt him．The lion thereupon conceived an enmity against the tree，and when a carpenter came in search of wood for a cartwheel，suggested to him that he should cut down that very tree as the wood would be excellent for his purpose．The deity of the tree，discovering this，appeared before the carpenter and told him that if he placed four inches of the hide of a lion on the rim of his wheel its value would be greatly enhanced． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe carpenter，adopting both suggestions，killed the lion and cut down the tree （J．iv．207ff）．This was one of the stories related by the Buddha in the course of the quarrel between the Sākiyans and the Koliyans．SNA．i．358．"]]
