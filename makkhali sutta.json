[["V","Makkhali Sutta：A man with perverted view leads many people away from righteousness and plants them in unrighteousness．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no other thing so greatly to be blamed as wrong view．Like a fish trap set at a river mouth is Makkhali，existing for the distress and destruction of many beings．He who urges adherence to a doctrine and discipline rightly expounded，he whom he thus urges，and he who，thus urged，walks therein accordingly，all alike beget much merit．A．i．33f．"]]
