[["V","Mahātissabhūti Thera：An incumbent of the Mandalārāma．While begging for alms in the village，his mind was defiled by an unusual sight．He therefore returned to the vihāra，but，even in his sleep，he was haunted by what he had seen，and，greatly agitated，he went to Mahāsangharakkhita and obtained from him a formula of meditation with which to counteract the lustful feelings．With this formula he went into a thicket and lay on his pamsukūla robe and became an anāgāmī．MA．i．55．"]]
