[["V","Vaggamudātīriyā：Monks who lived on the banks of the Vaggumudā，evidently distinct from Yasoja （q．v．） and his companions．When there was scarcity of food in the Vajji country these monks went about praising each other’s superhuman qualities so that the laymen，deceived by their pretensions，kept them in great luxury．When the Buddha discovered this，he rebuked them strongly and laid down the rules concerning the fourth Pārājikā offence．Vin．iii．87ff．； Sp．ii．481ff．； DhA．iii．480．\t"]]
