[["V","Dhamma Jātaka：The Bodhisatta once became a Kāmāvacara-god，named Dhamma，and Devadatta became Adhamma．On uposatha-days Dhamma would appear among men and urge them to lead virtuous lives，while Adhamma encouraged them in wickedness．One day，their two chariots meeting in mid-air，they each claimed the right of way．But at the end of the argument Adhamma’s chariot fell headlong to earth，where he was swallowed up into hell．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to Devadatta’s being swallowed up in Avīci．J.iv.100-4."]]
