[["V","Vighāsa Jātaka：Once seven brothers of a Kāsi village renounced the world and lived as ascetics in Mejjhārañña，but they were given up to various amusements．The Bodhisatta，who was Sakka，saw this，and，assuming the form of a parrot，visited them and sang the praises of the ascetic life．They expressed their joy at being thus praised，but the parrot went on to make them understand that their lives were useless； they were mere refuse eaters and not ascetics．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to the monks mentioned in the Pāsādakampana Sutta （q．v．）．The monks are identified with the seven ascetics．J．iii．310f．\t"]]
