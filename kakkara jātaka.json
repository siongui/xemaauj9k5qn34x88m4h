[["V","Kakkara Jātaka：The story of a wise bird who，seeing a farmer trying to catch him，avoided him till the farmer was quite exasperated．In the end the farmer camouflaged himself like a tree，but the bird laughed in his face．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to a monk，a fellow-celibate ofSāriputta．This monk was very careful about his body，and earned the reputation of a dandy．The bird is identified with the monk （J．ii．161f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis story bears some resemblance to the second Sakuntaka Jātaka in the Mahāvastu，particularly to the latter part of it．v．l．Kukkura．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMtu．ii．250．"]]
