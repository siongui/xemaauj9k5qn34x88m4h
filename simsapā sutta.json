[["V","Simsapā Sutta：The Buddha，while staying in Simsapāvana in Kosambī，takes up a handful of leaves and tells the monks that the things he has discovered and not revealed，compared to those he has revealed，are as the handful of leaves to the leaves in the forest．What he has not revealed does not conduce to tranquillity，Nibbāna．He has revealed Ill，its cause，cessation，and the way thereto； this does conduce to Nibbāna．S．v．437．"]]
