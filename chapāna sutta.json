[["V","Chapāna Sutta：If a man were to catch six animals - a snake，a crocodile，a bird，a dog，a jackal and a monkey - and tether them with ropes，they would struggle to be free and to make off，each to his own range or pasture．So do a man’s six senses．If the animals are strongly tethered，they will，with time，grow weary and rest．So will the six senses if one practises attention to the body．S.iv.197； cp．Vsm.484."]]
