[["V","Upādiyamāna Sutta：When asked by a certain monk to give a topic for reflection，the Buddha tells him that if a man clings，he is Māra’s bondsman．If he cling not，he is free．The Buddha asks the monk what be understands by this and is pleased with the explanation．The monk meditates on this and becomes an arahant．S．iii．73f．"]]
