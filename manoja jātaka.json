[["V","Manoja Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once a lion and had a son called Manoja．One day Manoja，in spite of his father’s warnings，made friends with a jackal called Giriya．Acting on Giriya’s suggestion，Manoja went in search of horse flesh and attacked the king’s horses，The king engaged the services of an archer，who shot Manoja as he was making off with a horse．Manoja managed to reach his den，but there he fell down dead （J．iii．321ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe circumstances in which the story was related are similar to those of the Mahilāmukha Jātaka （q．v．）．"]]
