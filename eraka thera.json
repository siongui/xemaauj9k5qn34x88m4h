[["V","Eraka Thera：An arahant．He was the son of an eminent family of Sāvatthi．He had many advantages over others，among them beauty and charm．His parents married him to a suitable wife but，because it was his last life，he sought the Buddha．After hearing the Buddha preach he left the world，but for several days he was overcome by evil thoughts．The Buddha thereupon admonished him in a verse，and Eraka gained arahantship （Thag.v.93； ThagA.i.192f； for the name see Brethren，p.86，n.2）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Siddhattha Buddha he was a householder．One day he saw the Buddha and，having nothing to give，cleaned the road along which the Buddha walked and stood looking at him with clasped hands．Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Suppabuddha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably identical with Maggadāyaka Thera of the Apadāna．Ap.i.173."]]
