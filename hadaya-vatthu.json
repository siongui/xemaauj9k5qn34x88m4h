[["N","hadaya-vatthu：'heart as physical base' of mental life．The heart，according to the commentaries as well as to the general Buddhist tradition，forms the physical base （\u003ci\u003evatthu\u003c/i\u003e） of consciousness In the canonical texts，however，even in the \u003ci\u003eAbhidhamma\u003c/i\u003e \u003ci\u003ePiṭaka\u003c/i\u003e，no such base is ever localized，a fact which seems to have first been discovered by Shwe Zan Aung （Compendium of Philosophy，pp．277ff.）．In the Patth．we find repeatedly only the passage：That material thing based on which mind-element and mind-consciousness element function＂ （\u003ci\u003eyaṃ  rūpaṃ nissāya manodhātu ca manoviññāṇadhātu ca vattanti，taṃ rūpaṃ\u003c/i\u003e）."]]
