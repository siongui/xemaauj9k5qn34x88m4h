[["V","Cūla Gosinga Sutta：The Buddha，residing at the Giñjakāvasatha in Nādikā，visits the Gosinga-Sālavana，where dwell Anuruddha，Nandiya and Kimbila．（According to the Vinaya account （i.350），this incident takes place in Pācīnavamsadāya）．At first the keeper tries to stop the Buddha from approaching them，fearing lest he should disturb their meditation．The Buddha questions them as to their attainments and praises them．At the end of the sutta mention is made of a Yakkha，named Dīgha，visiting the Buddha and telling him how the fame of the three Elders had travelled even to the world of Brahmā （M.i.205-11）．The sutta illustrates the greatness of harmony （sāmaggi）．MA.i.361."]]
