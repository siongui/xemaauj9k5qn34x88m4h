[["V","Pātimokkha Sutta：A monk asks the Buddha for a brief teaching．The   Buddha tells him that he should dwell in the self control of the Pātimokkha，  well equipped in his range of practice （ācāragocarasampanno），seeing danger in   the minutest faults and undertaking the precepts．Thus will he be able to   develop the four satipatthānas．S．v．187．"]]
