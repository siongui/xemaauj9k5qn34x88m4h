e．g．，in the Bhūridatta Jātaka - of Nāgas，both male and female，mating with humans； but the offspring of such unions are watery and delicate （J．vi．160）．The Nāgas are easily angered and passionate，their breath is poisonous，and their glance can be deadly （J．vi．160，164）．They are carnivorous （J．iii．361），their diet consisting chiefly of frogs （J．vi．169），and they sleep，when in the world of men，on ant hills （ibid．，170）．The enmity between the Nāgas and the Garulas is proverbial （D．ii．258）．At first the Garulas did not know how to seize the Nāgas，because the latter swallowed large stones so as to be of great weight，but they learnt how in the Pandara Jātaka．The Nāgas dance when music is played，but it is said （J．vi．191） that they never dance if any Garula is near （through fear） or in the presence of human dancers （through shame）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best known of all Nāgas is Mahākāla，king ofMañjerika-bhavana．He lives for a whole kappa，and is a very pious follower of the Buddha．The Nāgas of his world had the custodianship of a part of the Buddha’s relics till they were needed for the Māha Thūpa （Mhv．xxxi．27f．），and when the Bodhi tree was being brought to Ceylon they did it great honour during the voyage （Mbv．p．．163f．）．Other Nāga kings are also mentioned as ruling with great power and majesty and being converted to the Buddha’s faith - e．g．，Aravāla，Apalālā，Erapatta，Nandopananda，and Pannaka．（See also Ahicchatta and Ahināga．） In the Atānātiya Sutta （D．iii．198f．），speaking of dwellers of the Cātummahārajika world，the Nāgas are mentioned as occupying the Western Quarter，with Virūpokkha as their king．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nāgas had two chief settlements in Ceylon，in Nāgadīpa （q．v．） and at the mouth of the river Kalyānī．It was to settle a dispute between two Nāga chiefs of Nāgadīpa，Mahodara and Cūlodara，that the Buddha paid his second visit to Ceylon．During that visit he made a promise to another Nāga-king，Manjakkhika of Kalyānī，to pay him a visit，and the Buddha’s third visit was in fulfilment of that undertaking （Mhv．i．48f．）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Nāgas form one of the guards set up by Sakka in Sineru against the Asuras （J．i．204）．The Nāgas were sometimes worshipped by human beings and were offered sacrifices of milk，rice，fish，meat and strong drink （J．i．497f．）．The jewel of the Nāgas is famous for its beauty and its power of conferring wishes to its possessor （J．vi．179，180）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe word Nāga is often used as an epithet of the Buddha and the Arahants，and in this connection the etymology given is āgum na karotī ti Nāgo （e．g．，MNid．201）．The Bodhisatta was born several times as king of the Nāgas：Atula，Campeyya，Bhūridatta，Mahādaddara，and Sankhapāla．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the accounts given of the Nāgas，there is undoubtedly great confusion between the Nāgas as supernatural beings，as snakes，and as the name of certain non Aryan tribes，but the confusion is too difficult to unravel．"]]
