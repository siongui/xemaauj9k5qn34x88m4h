Was it because he slept on a luxurious bed? The Buddha answered that his bed was luxurious and comfortable，but from quite a different point of view．At the end of the discourse，Vacchagotta declares himself a follower of the Buddha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e3．Vacchagotta．\u003c/i\u003e A brahmin of Kapilavatthu，father of Vanavaccha Thera （q．v．）．ThagA．i．58．\t"],["K","vacchagotta：ဝစ္ဆဂေါတ္တ（တိ）\u003cbr\u003e  [ဝစ္ဆ+ဂေါတ္တ။ ဝစ္ဆဂေါတ္တ+ဏ]\u003cbr\u003e  （၁） ဝစ္ဆ+အမျိုး-အနွယ်-ရှိ-ဖြစ်-သော၊ ဝစ္ဆ-အမျိုး-အနွယ်-၌ဖြစ်သော၊ သူ။ （၂） ဝစ္ဆဂေါတ္တမည်သော၊ သူ။ （န） （၃） ဝစ္ဆ-အမျိုး-အနွယ်။ （၄） ဝစ္ဆဂေါတ္တတ္ထေရဂါထာ။\t"]]
