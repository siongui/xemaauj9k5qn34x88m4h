[["V","Dubbalakattha Jātaka：Once an elephant，caught in the Himālaya，while being trained by the king’s trainers，broke away from his chains and escaped to the mountains．There he lived in a constant state of terror until the Bodhisatta，who was a tree-sprite，dispelled his fears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a monk who was always in fear of death．He is identified with the elephant．J.i.414-6."]]
