[["V","Anāthapindika Sutta：1. Anāthapindika Sutta.-Similar to the Anāthapindikovāda Sutta （infra），but the greater part of this discourse is taken up with the words of consolation，courage and suggestion addressed by Sāriputta to the banker，and we are told that his pains were allayed. No mention is made of the advice not to cling to matters mundane，nor of the death of the banker almost immediately afterwards. Instead，it is stated that Sāriputta and Ananda were given a meal from the banker’s own cooking-pot and that they went away after thanking him. Ananda reports to the Buddha the news of their visit，and the Buddha praises Sāriputta for his wisdom. S.v.380-5.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.
