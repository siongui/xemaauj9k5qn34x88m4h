[["V","Bhisapuppha Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was born once as an ascetic，and one day a goddess，having seen him smell a lotus in bloom，upbraided him，telling him he was a thief to smell a lotus which did not belong to him．Near by was a man digging up lotus plants for their fibres，but to him the goddess said nothing．When questioned，her answer was that in a man like the Bodhisatta，seeking for purity，a sin even as large as a hair tip showed like a dark，cloud in the sky．The Bodhisatta，greatly impressed，thanked her．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goddess is identified with Uppalavannā．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a monk who was upbraided by a deity in a forest tract in Kosala for smelling a lotus．In great agitation，he went and consulted the Buddha，who told him the above story．J．iv．307ff．"]]
