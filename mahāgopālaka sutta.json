[["V","Mahāgopālaka Sutta：Preached to the monks at Jetavana．A herdsman who is ignorant of form，has no eye for marks，does not get out ticks，does not dress sores，does not smoke out lairs，knows nothing either of fords or watering places，roads or pastures，milks the cows dry，and fails to pay special attention to the leaders of the herd -  such a herdsman cannot look after his herd nor promote its increase．A monk who has the corresponding eleven bad qualities is not capable of showing growth and progress in the Dhamma and the Vinaya．M．i．220ff．； A．v．347ff．"]]
