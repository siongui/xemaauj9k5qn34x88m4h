[["V","Aranavibhanga Sutta：The 139th Sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya．It was preached at Jetavana and contains a statement and an exposition of the middle path of peace between the two extremes of pleasures of sense - low，ignoble and unprofitable - and self-mortification，also painful and unprofitable．The path is the Noble Eightfold Path：in preaching the doctrine the preacher should neither appreciate nor depreciate it，he should teach the truth in abstract terms of general principle．He should not be a tale-teller nor confront anyone with improper remarks; he should speak slowly and not hurriedly; he should neither affect provincialisms in speech nor depart from recognised parlance．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the discourse a young man，Subhūti，is praised because he walked where calm dwelt （M．iii．230-7; MA．ii．977-8）．"]]
