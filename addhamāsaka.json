[["V","Addhamāsaka：King. He was a poor man of Benares. He saved a halfpenny （addha-māsaka） and hid it in a brick wall. When the festival came round，wishing to take part in the fun with his wife，who had also saved a halfpenny，he travelled six leagues in the hot sun to fetch his savings from the hiding-place. King Udaya saw him as he passed by the palace singing，and having discovered his mission，gave him half of his kingdom. The man chose the half in which his halfpenny lay concealed. He later became an ascetic. His story is given in the Gangamāla Jātaka （J.iii.449 ff.； iv.174）. He was Ananda in the present age. J.iii.454."]]
