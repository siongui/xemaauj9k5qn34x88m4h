[["V","Junha Jātaka：Once the Bodhisatta was born as Junha，son of Brahmadatta，king of Benares．He studied in Takkasilā and，on one occasion，while walking in the dark，he ran up against a brahmin，knocking him down and breaking his bowl．Junha raised the brahmin to his feet and，on being asked for the price of a meal，told the brahmin who he was．He had no money with him，but requested the brahmin to remind him of the circumstance when he should become king．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn due time Junha was anointed，and the brahmin stood one day by the road when the king was passing on his elephant．The brahmin stretched out his hand，crying，”Victory to the king．” Junha took no notice，so the brahmin uttered a stanza to the effect that a king should not neglect a brahmin’s request．Junha then turned back，and the man explained who he was，asking Junha for five villages，one hundred slave girls，one thousand ornaments and two wives，all of which Junha gave him．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to the eight boons granted by the Buddha to Ananda when the latter became his constant attendant．Ananda is identified with the brahmin （J．iv．95-100）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee also the Nānacchanda Jātaka．"]]
