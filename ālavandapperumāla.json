[["V","Ālavandapperumāla：A Damila general defeated by Parakkamabāhu I，（Cv.lxxvi.128）. He belonged to the immediate retinue of King Kulasekhara. In the battle of Pātapa he was wounded and fled，but his enemies succeeded in slaying the horse on which he rode （Cv.lxxvi.223，232）. He is perhaps to be identified with ālavanda who was slain by Parakkamabāhu in the village of Vadali （Cv.lxxvi.134）."]]
