[["V","Sāketa Tissa Thera：He was not fond of learning，saying that he had no time for it．When asked by the others，”Have you time for death?” he left them and went to Kanikāravālikasamudda vihāra．There，during the rainy season，he was very helpful to the monks，both young and old，and at the end of the vassa，on the full moon day，he preached a sermon which greatly agitated his listeners．AA．i．44； cf．DA．iii．1061．"]]
