[["V","Pesakāradhītuvatthu：The story of a weaver’s daughter of ālavi．She heard the Buddha preach at the Aggālava cetiya on the necessity of meditating constantly on the inevitable ness of death and，though she was only sixteen，she was the only one to profit by the sermon．Three years later the Buddha again visited ālavi．The citizens entertained him，but the Buddha would not preach his thanksgiving sermon till the weaver’s daughter，having finished the tasks required of her by her father，was able to be present．On her arrival the Buddha asked her questions so that her wisdom might be known to the assembled populace，and，at the conclusion of the Buddha’s discourse，she became a sotāpanna．That same day she was killed by an accident to her loom，and her father joined the Order，attaining arahantship in due course．DhA．iii．170 6．"]]
