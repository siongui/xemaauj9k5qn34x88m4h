[["V","Guhatthaka Sutta：The second sutta of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta； it was preached toPindolabhāradvāja．He once went to Udakavana in Kosambī，and there the women of King Udena’s palace，who had come to the park with the king，left the king while he slept，and，finding the Elder，sat down and listened to his preaching．The king，awakening，went in search of them，and was angry when he discovered their where-abouts．He questioned Pindola as to the solitude which he professed to seek in the park，but Pindola refusing to answer，the king threatened to set red ants at him．Thereupon Pindola went through the air to the Buddha’s Gandhakuti and related the story．The Buddha was reclining on his bed and，in that position，preached this sutta to the Elder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA man who clings to the body and to the pleasures of the senses，lives in constant fear．One should therefore cast off greed and cross the flood，unstained by the world （SN.vv.772-9； SNA.ii.514ff）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sutta probably derives its name from the fact that，in the first verse，the body is spoken of as a guhā.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is commented on in the Mahā Niddesa pp.23ff."]]
