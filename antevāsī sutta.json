[["V","Antevāsī Sutta：A monk dwells at ease without a pupil or a teacher，  the pupil or co-resident （antevāsī） being the name given to evil and   unprofitable states of mind which arise in him and abide in him through the   senses. Such states are also called \u0026quot；teacher\u0026quot； （ācariya） because they beset and   master him. S.iv.136-8."]]
