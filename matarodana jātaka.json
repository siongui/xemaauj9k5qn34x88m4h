[["V","Matarodana Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once born in a family worth eighty crores．When his parents died，his brother managed the estate．Some time later the brother also died，but the Bodhisatta shed no tear．His relations and friends called him heartless，but he convinced them that he did not weep because he knew that all things are transient．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related to a landowner of Sāvatthi who gave himself up to despair on the death of his brother．The Buddha visited him and preached to him，and the man became a sotāpanna．J．iii．56 8．"]]
