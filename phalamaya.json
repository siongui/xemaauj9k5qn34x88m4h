[["P","Phalamaya，stands in all probability for phalika-maya，made of crystal，as is suggested by context，which gives it in line with kaṭṭha-maya \u0026 loha-maya （\u0026 aṭṭhi°，danta°，veḷu° etc．）．It occurs in same phrase at all passages mentioned，and refers to material of which boxes，vessels，holders etc．are made．Thus at Vin．I，203 （of añjani，box），205 （tumba，vessel）； II，115 （sattha-daṇḍa，scissors-handle），136 （gaṇṭhikā，block at dress）．The trsln “made of fruits” seems out of place （so Kern，Toev．s．v．），one should rather expect “made of crystal” by the side of made of wood，copper，bone，ivory，etc．（Page 477）"]]
