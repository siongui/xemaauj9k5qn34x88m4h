[["V","Nivāpa Sutta：Preached at Jetavana ； a parable of Māra as trapper．  He sets up various gins and snares to trap the unwary，and many are caught in   them．It is，however，possible to find a retreat，where Māra and his train   cannot penetrate； and the Buddha proceeds to explain how this may be found．  M．i．150ff．"]]
