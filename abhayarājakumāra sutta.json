[["V","Abhayarājakumāra Sutta：It contains the episode of Prince Abhaya visiting the Buddha at Rājagaha and setting him the questions suggested by Nigantha Nātaputta：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Would a Tathāgatha say anything unpleasant or disagreeable to others? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    If he did，how would he differ from ordinary men? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    If he did not，how was it that the Buddha spoke of Devadatta as a reprobate，a child of perdition，etc. - words which angered and upset Devadatta?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The Buddha answered that the question needed qualification and，noticing that the prince was nursing his little boy，who lay in his lap，asked him what he would do if a pebble or a stick got into his mouth. ”I should pull it out even if the blood flowed.” ”Just so would a Buddha state unpleasant truths in due season if necessary and profitable.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the discourse Abhaya accepts the Buddha as his Teacher （M.i.391ff）."]]
