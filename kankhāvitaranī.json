[["V","Kankhāvitaranī：A commentary，also called Mātikatthakathā，by Buddhaghosa on the Pātimokkha of the Vinaya Pitaka．The colophon also contains a summary，a kind of uddāna，of the contents．It is stated that the work was written at the request of a thera named Sona，and Buddhaghosa declares most emphatically that there is not even a single word in the book which is not in conformity with the Canon or the Commentaries of the Mahāvihāra （p．204，ed．Hewavitarane Bequest Series； Gv．59，69．）．The Gandhavamsa （61f，71； also Svd．1212） mentions a tīkā on the Kankhāvitaranī named Vinayatthamañjūsā，written by Buddhanāga at the request of Sumedha．"]]
