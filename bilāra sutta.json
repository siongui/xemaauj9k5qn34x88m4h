[["V","Bilāra Sutta：A cat once stood on the refuse heap of a house drain，and when the mouse who lived there came out，pounced on her and ate her．But the mouse gnawed the guts of the cat so that she died．Such will be the fate of monks who go among the dwellings of householders with unrestrained senses．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sutta was preached to a recalcitrant monk．S．ii．270．"]]
