There were no lamps in Jotika’s house； only the light of jewels was made use of，and as a memento of Bimbisāra’s visit Jotika gave him a huge jewel to be used as a lamp．（This account is taken from DhA．iv．199-213）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJotika was a very pious follower of the Buddha．Once，when he was away listening to the Buddha’s preaching，Ajātasattu - who even when visiting the palace as a boy with his father had coveted Jotika’s wealth - went with his soldiers to attack the palace in an attempt to take possession of it．But the Yakkha Yamakolī routed the army，and Ajātasattu fled for refuge to the vihāra where Jotika was listening to the Dhamma．On being charged by Ajātasattu with hypocrisy in that he was there listening to the Dhamma，after having charged his guards to set upon the king，Jotika’s answer was that he had no need of guards since nobody could take anything of his without his sanction．He then challenged the king to remove the rings from his （Jotika’s） fingers．Ajātasattu，trying with all his might，failed．Jotika then held out his hands and his rings all fell off．Agitated by the king’s desire to possess his wealth，Jotika asked for permission to become a monk．Ajātasattu agreed，hoping thus to get possession of his riches．Jotika entered the Order and soon became an arahant，but at the moment of his attainment of arahantship all his wealth and earthly glory vanished and his wife returned to Uttarakuru （DhA．iv．221-4）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJotika is included among the five persons who possessed great merit and had puññiddhi．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDhA．i．385； Vsm．383； PsA．502．These five persons are described as amitabhogā （AA．i．220）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Jotika．\u003c/i\u003e-A householder of Rājagaha and father of Dīghāvu．When Dīghāvu fell ill he sent Jotika to tell the Buddha （S．v．344f）．"],["K","jotika：ဇောတိက（ပု）\u003cbr\u003e  [ဇုတ+ဏွု]\u003cbr\u003e  （၁） ဇောတိကမည်သော သူ （က） ဇောတိကသူဌေး။ （ခ） ဒီဃာဝု၏ဖခင် ဇောတိကသူကြွယ်။ （၂） မီးရှူး၊ မီးတိုင်။ （က） ဇောတိကသူဌေးသည် ဘုရားရှင်လက်ထက် ရာဇဂြိုဟ်ပြည့်ရှင် ဘုရင်ဗိမ္ဗိသာရမင်း၏ တိုင်းနိုင်ငံအတွင်း၌ နေထိုင်သော ဇောတိက，ဇဋိလ，မေဏ္ဍက，ကာကဝလိယ，ပုဏ္ဏဟူသော 'အမိတဘောဂ' သူဌေးကြီး ၅-ဦးတွင် တစ်ဦးအပါအဝင်ဖြစ်သည်။မူရင်းကြည့်ပါ။"],["K","jotika：ဇောတိက（တိ）\u003cbr\u003e  [ဇောတိ+ဏိက]\u003cbr\u003e  နက္ခတ်ဗေဒင်ကို သင်ယူသော၊ သူ။"],["K","jotika：ဇောတိက（န）\u003cbr\u003e  [ဇောတိက+ကရဏ။ ကရဏ၌ ရဏကို ချေ။]\u003cbr\u003e  မီးကိုပြုခြင်း၊ မီးမွှေးခြင်း။"],["R","jotika：ဇောတိက\t（ပ၊န） \u003cbr\u003eမီးရှူး။ ဇောတိကသူဌေး။ "],["R","jotika：ဇောတိက\t（တိ） \u003cbr\u003eထွန်းပြတတ်သော။ "]]
