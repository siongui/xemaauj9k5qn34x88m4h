[["V","Dīparājā：A king of Nāgadīpa，son of a king of Ceylon by a younger queen．The king granted the queen a boon and she claimed the kingdom for her son．But the prince was blinded in one eye while watching a cock fight and the king refused to grant the request．So he made him king of Nāgadīpa，whence he came to be known as Dīparājā （VibhA.443f）."]]
