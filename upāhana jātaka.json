[["V","Upāhana Jātaka：Once the Bodhisatta was an elephant-trainer and taught his art to a young man of Kāsi．The latter wished to take service under the king，but would not accept any fee less than that paid to his teacher．A contest of skill was arranged to settle the point．The night before the contest the Bodhisatta taught an elephant to do all things awry，going back when told to go forward，etc．At the time of the contest the pupil could not match this in any way and was defeated and stoned to death by the onlookers．The Bodhisatta thereupon declared that a low-bred churl was like an ill-made shoe （upāhana）．The story was told concerning the base ingratitude of Devadatta．J．ii．221ff．"]]
