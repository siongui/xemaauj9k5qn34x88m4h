[["V","Migasālā Sutta：Ananda visits Migasālā in her home and is questioned as to why both Pūrana and Isidatta，the former of whom was a brahmacārī and the latter not，should both have been born in Tusita，as sakadāgāmins．Ananda offers no explanation，but consults the Buddha，who declares that Migasālā is but a foolish，frail，motherly body with none but mother wit； how，then，could she understand the diversity in the person of man? （purisa-puggala-paropariyañāna）．The Buddha then goes on to divide men into six classes according to their capabilities and attainments．It is not possible for anyone，save a Tathāgata，to measure persons．A．iii．347ff．； v．137ff．"]]
