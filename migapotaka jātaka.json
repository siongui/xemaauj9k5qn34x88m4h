[["V","Migapotaka Jātaka：Once a certain ascetic in Himavā adopted a young deer which had lost its dam．The deer grew up most comely but died from over eating．The ascetic lamented greatly till Sakka （the Bodhisatta） appeared before him and pointed out the folly of his sorrow．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to an old man of Sāvatthi who looked after a novice very devotedly．The novice died and the old man abandoned himself to grief．The characters in both stories were identical．J．iii．213-15．"]]
