[["V","Pādañjali Jātaka：Brahmadatta，king of Benares，had a son Pādañjali，who was an idle loafer．When the king died，the courtiers，headed by the Bodhisatta who was the chaplain，went to test him．At everything the boy sneered with a superior air，whether it were right or wrong； and the Bodhisatta was made king in his stead．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to Lāludāyī，who once curled his lip in scorn when the two chief disciples were praised．LāIudāyi is identified with Pādañjali．J．ii．263f．"]]
