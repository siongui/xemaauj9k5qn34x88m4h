[["V","Nagaravindeyya Sutta：Preached to the brahmins of Nagaravinda．One   should honour and reverence only such Wanderers as have shed lust and hate and   folly，have a tranquil heart，and walk in the paths of righteousness．Such   Wanderers dwell in remote solitudes where there exists nothing which might   excite their senses．M．iii．290ff．"]]
