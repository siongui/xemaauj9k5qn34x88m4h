[["V","Kumāra Sutta：The Licchavi Mahānāma sees a number of Licchavi youths sitting by the Buddha，at the foot of a tree in the Mahāvana at Vesāli； be expresses his joy at the sight for，he says，the Licchavis are usually so mischievous．The Buddha thereupon tells Mahānāma of five things the practice of which will tend to progress：the tending of father and mother，the support of wife and children with well-gotten wealth，devotion to one’s own business，honouring one’s own ancestral gods，showing respect to good and holy men．A．iii．75ff．"]]
