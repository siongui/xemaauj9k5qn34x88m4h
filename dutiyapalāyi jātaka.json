[["V","Dutiyapalāyi Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once king of Benares，and the Gandhāra king of Takkasilā besieged his capital．The Bodhisatta appeared before him and threatened to crush his forces，and the Gandhāra king fled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to an ascetic who visitedJetavana in order to argue with the Buddha； but on seeing the Buddha seated in the hall expounding the Doctrine，his courage forsook him and he ran away with a crowd at his heels．He is identified with the Gandhāra king．（J.ii.219-21）."]]
