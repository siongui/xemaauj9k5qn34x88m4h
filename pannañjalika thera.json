[["V","Pannañjalika Thera：An arahant．Ninety two kappas ago he lay   grievously ill at the foot of a tree in the forest．The Buddha Tissa，in his   compassion，came to him，and Pannañjalika，unable to rise，clasped his hands   above his head and worshipped the Buddha．Five kappas ago he was king five   times，under the name of Mahāsikha．Ap．i．128．"]]
