[["N","saṃvega-vatthu：'the sources of emotion'，or of a sense of urgency，are 8：birth，old age，disease，death，being 4； the suffering in the lower states of existence being the 5th； further，the misery of the past rooted in the cycle of rebirth，the misery of the future rooted in the cycle of rebirth，the misery of the present rooted in the search after food＂ （Vis．M．III．）．"]]
