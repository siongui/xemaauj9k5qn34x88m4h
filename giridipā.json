[["V","Giridipā：An island near Ceylon．When the Buddha visited Ceylon he drew Giridipā up to Ceylon，told the yakkhas to go on to it，and then restored it to its former place （Mhv.i.30； Dpv.i.67f）．Geiger （Mhv.Trs.，p.4，n.4） thinks that the reference is not to an island，but to the highlands （giri） in the interior of Ceylon."]]
