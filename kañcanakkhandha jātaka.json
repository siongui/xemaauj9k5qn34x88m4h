[["V","Kañcanakkhandha Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once born as a farmer and，while ploughing his field，came upon a nugget of gold，four cubits long and as thick as a man’s thigh，which had been buried by a merchant in bygone days．Finding it impossible to remove the gold as a whole，he cut it into four and carried it home easily．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to a monk who wished to leave the Order because he was frightened by all the rules his teachers asked him to learn and obey．The Buddha gave him three rules - to guard voice，body and mind - and the monk won arahantship．Even a heavy burden becomes light if carried piece by piece．J．i．276-8．"]]
