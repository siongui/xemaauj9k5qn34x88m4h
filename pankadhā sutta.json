[["V","Pankadhā Sutta：When the Buddha stayed at Pañkadhā during one of his tours and instructed the monks there，Kassapa of the Hampagotta disapproved of his teaching，thinking that he was too scrupulous．But later，when the Buddha returned to Rājagaha，Kassapa，filled with remorse，followed him thither，and confessing his transgression，begged for forgiveness．The Buddha praised him for having made confession，and said that only those monks who were zealous in the practice of religion deserved praise，but others did not．A．i．236f．"]]
