[["V","Upassaya Sutta：Ananda，with great difficulty，persuades Mahā Kassapa to accompany him to a settlement of nuns．Mahā Kassapa goes and preaches to them，but Thulla-Tissā，not being pleased with the sermon，upbraids Mahā Kassapa for what she calls his impertinence in preaching when Ananda is present．”How does the needle-pedlar deem he could sell a needle to the needle-maker?” Kassapa is upset，and Ananda asks for forgiveness in the nun’s name，for women，he says，are foolish，and one must be indulgent to them．Kassapa reminds the audience that it was he himself and not Ananda who was declared by the Buddha to be the Buddha’s equal in the attainment of the jhānas．S．ii．214．"]]
