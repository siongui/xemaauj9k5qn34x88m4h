[["V","Sangīti Sutta：The thirty third sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya （D．iii．207ff），preached at Ubbhataka，the new Mote Hall of the Mallas of Pāvā．They had invited the Buddha to consecrate it by preaching there，and this he did until late into the night．Then，seeing that his audience wished for more，he asked Sāriputta to continue the preaching while he himself rested．Sāriputta therefore preached the Sangīti Sutta，at the end of which the Buddha expressed his great appreciation of Sāriputta’s exposition．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis sutta，like the Dasuttara，is arranged in a new plan -  which is regularly followed in the Anguttara Nikāya -  of grouping the points or chief items brought forward，numerically，in arithmetical progression - in this case 1 to 10．This scheme is a kind of thematic index to the doctrines scattered through the Four Nikāyas．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Sarvāstivādins held this Sutta in high esteem，and included it （under the name of Sangītipariyāya） among the seven books constituting their Abhidhamma Pitaka．The Tibetan recensions attribute the Sutta to Mahā Kotthita．See Takākusu’s article on the Sarvāstivādins （J．P．T．S．1904 5）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sutta treats of the dasadhammā （or ten conditions） in much the same way as the Puggala-Paññatti deals with the dasapuggalā （ten individuals）．"]]
