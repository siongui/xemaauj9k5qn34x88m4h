[["V","Cīvara Sutta：Once，when Mahā Kassapa was at Veluvana in Rājagaha，Ananda returned from a tour in the Dakkhināgiri，with thirty monks，mostly youths．They were ill-behaved，and Kassapa blamed Ananda for going about with them，calling him ”corn-tramper，” ”despoiler of families，” and，finally，”a boy.” Ananda gently reminded him that being grey-haired he could hardly be called a boy，but Kassapa refused to listen．Thulla-Nandā，hearing of this，vented her displeasure on Kassapa by reminding him that he was once a heretical teacher．Kassapa there-upon remonstrated with Ananda，pointing out that he was a very devoted follower and pupil of the Buddha and relating how，on one occasion，the Buddha accepted from him the gift of his soft robe，giving him，in return，the Buddha’s rag-robe．Well might he，he said，claim to be a real son of the Buddha．S.1217ff"]]
