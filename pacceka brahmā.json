[["V","Pacceka Brahmā：Mention is made in one or two places in the books   of Brahmas who are described as Pacceka Brahmā -\u0026nbsp； e．g．，Subrahmā，Suddhāvāsa   and Tudu．I have not come across any explanation of this term．It may   designate a Brahmā who does not live in any recognized Brahmā world，but in a   world of his own．"]]
