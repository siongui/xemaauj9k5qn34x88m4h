[["V","Kimpakka Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once the leader of a caravan．During a journey through a forest he gave orders to his men not to eat any fruit without his leave．Seeing the fruit of a kimpakka-tree，which in appearance and flavour resembled a mango，some of the men ate of the fruit and died in spite of efforts to save them．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related to a monk who was stirred to lust by the sight of a beautifully dressed woman in Sāvatthi．Lusts of the senses are like the fruit of the kimpakka-tree，sweet and attractive in the hour of enjoyment，but leading later to death．J．i．367f"]]
