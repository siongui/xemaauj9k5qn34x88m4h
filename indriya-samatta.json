[["N","indriya-samatta：This term is probably found for the first time in the Com．，esp．Vis．M．IV．The rudiments of this doctrine，however，are already found in the old sutta texts，e．g．A．III，100．"],["N","indriya-samatta：'equilibrium，balance，or harmony of faculties'，relates to the 5 spiritual faculties：faith，energy，mindfulness，concentration and wisdom （s．\u003ci\u003eindriya\u003c/i\u003e 15-19）．Of these there are two pairs of faculties，in each of which both faculties should well counter\u003ci\u003e-\u003c/i\u003ebalance each other，namely：faith and wisdom （\u003ci\u003esaddhā\u003c/i\u003e，\u003ci\u003epaññā\u003c/i\u003e，q．v．） on the one hand and energy and concentration （\u003ci\u003eviriya\u003c/i\u003e，\u003ci\u003esamādhi\u003c/i\u003e，q．v．） on the other．For excessive faith with deficient wisdom leads to blind belief，whilst excessive wisdom with deficient faith leads to cunning．In the same way，great energy with weak concentration leads to restlessness，whilst strong concentration with deficient energy leads to indolence．Though for both faculties in each of the 2 pairs a balanced degree of intensity is desirable，mindfulness should be allowed to develop to the highest degree of strength．Cf．Vis．M．III- （App．）．"]]
