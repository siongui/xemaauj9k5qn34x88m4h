[["V","Samiddhisummana：A Deva who lived in the rājāyatana tree standing at the gate of Jetavana．He accompanied the Buddha on his second visit to Ceylon．In his last birth he had been a man in Nāgadīpa，and seeing some Pacceka Buddhas eating their meal，had provided them with rājāyatana branches with which to clean their bowls．The rājāyatana-tree was held as parasol over the Buddha’s head on his journey to Ceylon and was left behind in Kalyāni for the Nāgas to worship．Mhv．i．52ff．"]]
