[["V","Sakunagghi Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once a quail and was seized one day by a falcon．The quail lamented，saying that if he had remained in the feeding ground of his own people he would not have suffered thus．The falcon，hearing this，let him go，saying that he could catch him，no matter where he was．The quail flew back and perched on an immense clod，whence he called to the falcon．The falcon swooped down，but the quail just turned over，and the falcon was dashed to pieces against the clod．J．ii．58f．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Jātaka was related on the occasion of the preaching of the Sakunovāda Sutta （q．v．）．"]]
