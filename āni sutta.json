[["V","Āni Sutta：Like the ānaka drum of theDasārahas，in which the drumhead vanished，leaving only the framework of pegs，even so is it with the Suttantas of the Tathāgata which are deep in meaning. They lie neglected and forgotten while men will turn their attention to the Suttantas of poets and the utterances of disciples，full of words； these they will learn and master instead of the Buddha’s own teachings. S.ii.266-7."]]
