[["V","Bhaddāli Sutta：Preached to Bhaddāli （q．v．） when he confessed his fault．The monk，who believes in the Buddha and obeys his instructions，will ultimately understand dukkka and will bring it to an end．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sutta also contains the parable of the Ajāniya horse．A horse，schooled by an expert trainer and put through the various stages of training，becomes endowed with ten qualities，and is fit to be regarded as a treasure by a king．Similarly，a man who has developed the Noble Eightfold Path and obtained right knowledge and right deliverance，becomes the richest field in which the seed of merit may be sown．M．i．437ff．"]]
