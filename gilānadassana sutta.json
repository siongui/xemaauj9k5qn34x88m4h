[["V","Gilānadassana Sutta：When Citta-gahapati lies ill various devas approach him and urge him to aspire to be a world-ruler．He scorns the suggestion and，on being asked by his relations why he is talking to himself，he tells them and exhorts them to have faith in the Buddha，the Dhamma and the Sangha．Soon afterwards he dies．S.iv.302f."]]
