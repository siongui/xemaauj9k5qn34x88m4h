[["V","Puppharatta Jātaka：Once，during the Kattika Festival in Benares，the wife of a poor man insisted on having a pair of garments dyed with safflower to wear at the festival．Urged by her desire，the husband stole at night into the king’s conservatories to get the safflowers．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe was caught by the guard and impaled alive．He died lamenting the non fulfilment of his wife’s desire and was born in hell．The Bodhisatta was，at that time，a Spirit of the Air．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told to a passion tossed monk who longed for the wife of his lay life．The couple are identified with that of the story．J．i．149f．"]]
