if they were really two．In the Jātaka Commentary，for instance，the introductory stories of several of the Jātakas refer to the Takkāriya Jātaka for details of Kokālika，obviously having in mind Devadatta’s partisan； but the introductory story of the Takkāriya Jātaka is identical with that related elsewhere of Cūla Kokālika．See also DhA．iv．91f，where the story of the talkative tortoise is related to Kokālika of the Kokālika Sutta which，according to Buddhaghosa （SNA．ii．473） refers to Cūla Kokālika．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Vyaggha Jātaka （J．ii．356） Kokālika is mentioned as having tried to persuade Sāriputta and Moggallāna to go with him to his own country and as having been very angry when they refused．Possibly this story also refers to Cūla Kokālika．See alsoDevadatta．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Kokālika （Kokāliya）\u003c/i\u003e．-A monk，also called Cūla Kokālika to distinguish him from Kokālika （1）．He was the son of Kokāli-setthi of Kokāli and lived in the monastery erected by his father in Kokāli．Once the two Chief Disciples，desiring quiet，spent the rainy season with him，he promising to tell nobody of their presence．After the rains，as the Elders were about to return，Kokālika informed the inhabitants of their stay and blamed them for not showing them hospitality．The townspeople hurried to the Elders with various offerings； these were，however，refused，and Kokālika，who had expected that the gifts would be given to him，was disappointed．The Elders promised the townsmen to visit them again，and on their return were accompanied by a large following of monks to whom the townsmen showed all honour．The gifts were divided among the monks，Kokālika not receiving a share．He thereupon became abusive，and the Chief Disciples left the place．The people were annoyed，and insisted that Kokālika should either bring them back or depart himself．The Elders refused to return，and Kokālika，in great anger，sought theBuddha at Sāvatthi，and in spite of his injunctions spoke ill of the Chief Disciples．Having three times accused the Elders of sinful desires，he left Jetavana，but boils immediately came out on his body，swelling and bursting．Groaning with pain，he fell down at the gate of Jetavana．His spiritual teacher，the anāgāmī Brahmā，Tudu，hearing his cries，came to him and begged him to seek forgiveness from the Elders．But he cursed the Brahmā and refused to listen to him．Kokālika died and was born inPaduma-niraya．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eS．i．149ff； A．v．171f； SN．123f； SNA．ii．473f； J．iv．242f； AA．ii．850； SA．i．167f； DhA．iv．91f．The different sources vary in a few minor details； the Jātaka version is the fullest．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was in reference to this incident that theTakkāriya Jātaka was preached．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Brahmā Sahampati informed the Buddha of Kokālika’s birth in the Paduma-niraya （S．i．151； SN．p．125）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kokālika Sutta was preached in reference to this Kokālika．See also Kokālika （1）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKokālika is mentioned as an example of a person guilty of misdemeanour regarding the Buddha’s disciples （Tathāgatasāvake micchāpatipanno）．AA．i．335，466．"],["K","kokālika：ကောကာလိက\t（ပု）\u003cbr\u003e  [¿]\u003cbr\u003e  \tကောကာလိကရဟန်း။"]]
