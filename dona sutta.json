[["V","Dona Sutta：A brahmin，Dona （probably identical with Dona 1 above），visits the Buddha and asks if it be true that the Buddha does not honour brahmins．The Buddha tells him that there are five kinds of brahmins - the Brahma-like，the deva-like，the bound，the breaker of bonds，and the brahmin-outcast - and，at Dona’s request，describes these in detail （A.iii.223ff）．The classification of brahmins given in this sutta is often referred to．E.g.，SNA.i.318，325，etc."]]
