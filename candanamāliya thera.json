[["V","Candanamāliya Thera：An arahant．He was a brahmin who entered the Order at the age of five，becoming an arahant in the tonsure-ball．In the time of Sumedha Buddha he was an ascetic who had renounced great wealth．Having met the Buddha，he offered him a seat and gave him mangoes，sandalwood and sāla-flowers．He was once king of the city of Vebhāra （Ap．ii．423f）．He is probably identical with Valliya Thera．See ThagA．i．293．"]]
