[["V","Vadhukā Sutta：When a young wife is first led home she is full of fear and bashfulness，not only towards her relations but also towards the servants．So is a monk who has just entered homelessness full of fear and bashfulness，even before novices of the monastery．As time goes on，this feeling，in both cases，gives place to boldness．But a monk should always be like a newly wed wife．A．ii．78f．\t"]]
