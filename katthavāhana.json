[["V","Katthavāhana：\u003ci\u003e1．Katthavāhana．\u003c/i\u003e-A king．A previous birth of Bāvarī．Katthavāhana had been a very clever carpenter of Benares，having under him sixteen thousand and sixteen assistants．They paid periodical visits to the Himalaya forests，felled trees，and having prepared the timber which was suitable for building purposes，brought it down the Ganges and erected houses for the king and for the people．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing tired of this work，these carpenters made flying machines of light wood，and going northwards from Benares to Himavā，established by conquest a kingdom，the chief carpenter becoming the king．He came to be called Katthavāhana，the capital was named Katthavāhananagara and the country Katthavāhanarattha．The king was righteous and the people very happy and the country prospered greatly．Later Katthavāhana and the king of Benares became sincere friends，and free trade，exempt from all taxes，was established between the two countries．The kings sent each other very costly and magnificent gifts．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce Katthavāhana sent to the king of Benares eight priceless rugs in eight caskets of lacquered ivory，each rug being sixteen cubits long and eight cubits wide and of unsurpassed splendour．The Benares king，wondering how he could adequately return the courtesy，decided to let his friend learn the great news of the appearance in the world of the Buddha （Kassapa），the Dhamma and the Sangha．This message was written on a gold leaf and the leaf enclosed in many caskets，one inside the other，the innermost casket being made of the seven kinds of jewels and the outermost of costly wood．The caskets were placed on a splendid palanquin and sent on the back of a royal elephant，accompanied by all the insignia of royalty．All along the route the honours due to a king were paid to the casket，and Katthavāhana himself escorted the elephant from the frontiers of his kingdom to the capital．When Katthavāhana discovered the message，he was overjoyed，and sent his nephew with sixteen of his ministers and sixteen thousand followers to investigate the matter and convey his greetings to the Buddha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe envoys arrived at Benares only after the Buddha’s death，but hearing from the Buddha’s disciples of the Doctrine he had proclaimed to the world，the ministers and their followers entered the Order，while Katthavāhana’s nephew was sent back to report the news to the king，taking with him the Buddha’s water-pot，a branch of the Bodhi tree and a monk versed in the Doctrine．The king，having learnt the Doctrine，engaged in various works of piety till his death，after which he was born among the Kāmāvacara devas．SnA．ii．675ff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Katthavāhana．\u003c/i\u003e-King of Benares．He was the Bodhisatta，son of Brahmadatta，king of Benares，and of a faggot-gatherer，whom the king met in a grove，singing as she picked up the sticks．His story is related in the Katthahāri Jātaka．J．i．133ff； DhA．i．349； J．iv．148．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e3．Katthavāhana．\u003c/i\u003e-A king．He had been a master builder and built forBodhirājakumāra，a palace calledKokanadā，unrivalled in its splendour．In order to prevent the building of a similar palace for anyone else，the prince decided to make away with the master builder at the conclusion of his work，and confided his plan to his friend Sañjikāputta．The latter，being most distressed at this suggestion of wanton cruelty，warned the builder who，procuring seasoned timber with sap well dried，under pretence that it was needed for the palace，shut himself up and fashioned a wooden Garuda-bird，large enough to hold himself and his family．When his preparations were complete，the builder with his family mounted the bird and rode away through the air to the Himalaya，where he founded a kingdom and became known as King Katthavāhana （DhA．iii．135f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story of the building of the palace is mentioned in the introduction to the Dhonasākha Jātaka （J．iii．157），but there we are told that the prince put out the builder’s eyes，and no mention is made of the wooden bird and the subsequent story．"]]
