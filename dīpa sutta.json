[["V","Dīpa Sutta：A monk should cultivate in-breathing and out-breathing in order to achieve all his desires in the spiritual life．He will then understand things as they really are and，when his bodily endurance has reached its limit，he will know that it is so，like a lamp which will go out when oil and wick are used up．S.v.316ff."]]
