[["V","Ghotamukha Sutta：Records a conversation between Udena Thera and Ghotamukha at Khemiyambavana，after the Buddha’s death．Ghotamukha maintains that there is a Recluse who might be called Righteous （dhammiko paribbājo）．Does Udena know of him? Udena describes to him the four types of individuals - those who torture themselves，those who torture others，those who torture both and those who torture neither，the last being those who live beyond appetites，consummate，unfevered and blissful．They want none of the things after which men hanker，but discarding them all go forth to homelessness．Ghotamukha admits that such are Righteous Recluses．M.ii.157ff"]]
