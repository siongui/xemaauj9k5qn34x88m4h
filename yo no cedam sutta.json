[["V","Yo no cedam Sutta：If there were no satisfaction from the earth element，beings would not   lust after it；   if there were no misery in it，they would not be repelled by it；   if there were no escape from it，beings would not so escape；   when all these things are fully known，beings will live aloof from the   world．S．ii．172．\t"]]
