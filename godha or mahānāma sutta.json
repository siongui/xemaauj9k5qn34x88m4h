[["V","Godha or Mahānāma Sutta：Mahānāma visits Godha the Sākiyan atKapilavatthu and asks him what qualities，possessed by a sotāpanna，will secure for him ultimate enlightenment．There are three，answers Godha-unwavering loyalty to the Buddha，the Dhamma and the Sangha．When Godha，in his turn，asks the same question of Mahānāma，the latter answers that there are four，and adds the possession of āriyan virtues．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe two seek the Buddha to ask his opinion．Mahānāma declares to the Buddha that he would accept the Buddha’s decision in face of the opinion of everyone else in the universe．In answer to a question of the Buddha，Godha answers that of a person who holds such a view he has nothing but good to say，the conclusion evidently being that he accepts Mahānāma’s opinion in preference to his own．S.v.371f."]]
