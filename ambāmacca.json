[["V","Ambāmacca：Son of Venigāma. He was very rich； but once，during a drought，there being no food，he made ready to go to the mountains with his retinue. Just before starting they found a measure of rice，and，having cooked it，were about to eat it，when Amba saw Cūlapindapātika-Nāga Thera returning from the village with empty bowl. He invited the monk and gave him the food. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Thera retired into the forest and attained arahantship before eating it. Tired and hungry，Amba slept，and，on waking，asked his wife if any scrapings were left. She went into the kitchen and found the pot full of food，which they shared with the whole village. Ras.ii.145f."]]
