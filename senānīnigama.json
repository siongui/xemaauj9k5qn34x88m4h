[["V","Senānīnigama：The village in which Senānī lived．It was the residence also of his daughter Sujātā，who gave milk-rice to the Buddha．It was near Uruvelā and on the banks of theNerañjarā （J．i．68）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name seems originally to have been Senānigama （E．g．，S．i．106； Vin．i．21； M．i．166，240）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa himself does not seem to have been sure of the spelling．He says （SA．i．135） it was so called because it was occupied by soldiers at the beginning of the kappa （pathamakappikānam senāya nivitthokāse patitthitagāmo） or because it was the village of Sujātā’s father Senānī （Sujātāya vā pitu Senānī nāma nigamo）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Lalitavistara （p．311，[248]） calls it Senāpatigrāma．"]]
