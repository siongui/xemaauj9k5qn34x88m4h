[["V","Uposathā：A pious lay-devotee of Sāketa．She did many deeds of merit，and was born in Tāvatimsa，her abode being known as the Uposatha-vimāna．It is said that she was known in Sāketa as Uposatha，because of the life she led．She expresses to Moggallāna her remorse that she should have desired to be born in Nandana-vana，instead of listening to the Buddha’s teaching and putting an end to all birth．Vv．20f； VvA．115f．"]]
