[["V","Gulissāni Sutta：Sāriputta notices among the monks at Rājagaha an uncouth monk from the wilds who is named Gulissāni．Sāriputta proceeds to talk to the other monks of the duties of a bhikkhu who，coming from the wilds，starts to live in the confraternity； he should show respect and consideration to others，be correct in the matter of seats，observe certain rules in begging for alms，and keep watch over his faculties while studying the higher Dhamma and Vinaya．Moggallāna asks whether these duties are incumbent only on those monks who come from the wilds，and is told that they are still more so on monks living in villages．M.i.469ff"]]
