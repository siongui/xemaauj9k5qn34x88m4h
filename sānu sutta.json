[["V","Sānu Sutta：Contains the conversation between Sānu’s mother and the Yakkhinī，who possessed Sānu （see Sānu） in order to prevent him from ”losing his soul．” Sānu’s mother says she cannot understand how Yakkhas can possess holy men who keep the fasts and lead holy lives．The Yakkhinī says she is right； but holiness consists in refraining from evil，both open and secret．Sānu’s mother understands，and，when her son regains consciousness and asks her why she weeps as he is not dead，she replies that he is as good as dead in that he wishes to return to the household life，like goods，which having been rescued from the fire，wish to be thrown into it once more．S．i．208f．"]]
