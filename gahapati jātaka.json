[["V","Gahapati Jātaka：Once，in Kāsi，the Bodhisatta’s wife carried on an intrigue with the village headman．The husband，determined to catch them，pretended to leave the village，but returned as soon as the headman entered the house．The wife，seeing her husband，climbed into the granary，and professed that the headman was there to demand the price of meat which he had supplied to them during a famine，and that as there was no money he insisted on being given the value in grain，which，she said，she was determined to refuse to do．But the Bodhisatta saw through the ruse，thrashed the headman and then his wife.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Buddha related the story to a backsliding monk to demonstrate to him how women were always sinful （J.ii.134f）."]]
