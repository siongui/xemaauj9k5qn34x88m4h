[["V","Chalangakumāra：A general sent by the king of Benares to instruct Elakamāra in the art of war； afterwards he became Elakamāra’s commander-in-chief．Elakamāra’s wife misconducted herself with Chalangakumāra and also with his attendant Dhanantevāsī．Kunāla said it was he who was Chalangakumāra and that，therefore，he was an incarnation of the Buddha．J.v.425，430."]]
