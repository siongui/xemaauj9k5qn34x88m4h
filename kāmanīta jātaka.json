[["V","Kāmanīta Jātaka：The king of Benares had two sons； the elder became king，but was full of greed for wealth．The rest of the story resembles that of theKāma Jātaka； the three cities which Sakka proposes to win for the king are given as Uttarapañcāla，Indapatta andKekaka．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn this case the physician who cures the king is Sakka himself，who is identified with the Bodhisatta （J．ii．212-16）．The story was related in the same circumstances as the Kāma Jātaka．"]]
