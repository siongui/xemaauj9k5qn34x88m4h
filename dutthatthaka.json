[["V","Dutthatthaka：The third Sutta of the Atthakavagga of the Sutta Nipāta （SN.vs.780-87）．The sutta was preached in reference to the calumny raised against the Buddha by the heretics who used the female ascetic Sundarī to further their ends （SNA.ii.518f）．Commentarial explanation of this is included in the Mahāniddesa （i.62ff）．The burden of the sutta is that he who praises his own virtue and is dependent upon varying dogmas of philosophy is constantly censured．The muni is one who has shaken off all systems of philosophy."]]
