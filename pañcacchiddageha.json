[["V","Pañcacchiddageha：A brahmin and his wife wished to give alms to four brahmins； the brahmin went to the monastery to fetch them．With him returned four arahant sāmaneras：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Sankicca （Saññkicca）  Pandita  Sopāka  RevataThe wife was angry at the sight of them and sent the man back．He brought，in turn，Sāriputta and Moggallāna，both of whom turned back on seeing the novices．Sakka’s throne was heated，as the novices sat hungry，and he came in the guise of a brahmin，entered the house，and sat down after worshipping the novices．The brahmin and his wife tried to turn him out； but failing in this，they fed all their five guests．Each of them made an opening in some part of the house，through which he departed．Henceforth the house was known as the Pañcacchiddageha．DhA．iv．176ff．"]]
