[["V","Giribhanda：A great festival，instituted by King Mahādāthika-Mahānāga on the Cetiyagiri mountain．Carpets were laid from the Kadambanadī to the mountain，in order that people might approach the mountain with clean feet； the road was decorated and illuminated，shops were erected and largesse distributed．There were mimes，songs and music．Lamps were lit throughout the island and even on the sea for one yojana round （Mhv.xxxiv.75ff； AA.i.13）．It is said （Vsm.376； Vsm.Trs.ii.436，n.4） that on the day of the festival Māra，wishing to spoil it，rained down a shower of coal，but an Elder created earth in the sky，thus preventing the coal from falling．The most costly offerings given during this feast to any monk - namely，a pair of garments - fell to the lot of a young novice，Lonagirivāsī Tissa，in spite of the efforts of the king’s ministers to get them into the hands of the older monks．It was because the novice had practised the sārānīya-dhammā （DA.ii.535； AA.ii.653f； MA.i.545f）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe festival was probably connected with the Giribhanda-vihāra，in which case that was the reason for the name."],["V","Giribhanda：A monastery in Ceylon restored by Udaya I （Cv.xlix.29）． See below，Giribhandapūjā."]]
