[["V","Mahā Assapura Sutta：Preached at Assapura，in the Anga country． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince monks are called recluses （samanā） they must train themselves to be true samanas and brāhmanas； they should be  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  conscientious and scrupulous，  pure in deed，word and thought，  guarding the portals of the senses，  moderate in eating，  ever vigilant，mindful and self possessed，  striving to put off the five nivaranā and cultivating the jhāna．Such an almsman can truly be called a samana，a brahmin，a nahātaka，vedagū，sotthiya，ariya，and arahant．He is an ideal recluse．M．i．271-80．"]]
