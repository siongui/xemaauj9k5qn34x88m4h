[["V","Chātapabbata：A mountain，slightly over two yojanas to the south-east of Anurādhapura．At the foot was a bamboo-grove in which grew three bamboo-stems，each being a waggon-pole in girth - known as latāyatthi，kusumayatthi and sakunayatthi - because of Devānampiyatissa’s good fortune （Mhv.xi.10； Dpv.xi.15，19； Sp.i.74．For an explanation of these yatthis see IHQ.vi.571ff）．Saddhātissa afterwards built a vihāra there，called the Chātavihāra （MT.300）．The Anguttara Commentary （i.15） has a reference to a novice dwelling in Chātapabbata who came to grief after hearing a woman’s voice."]]
