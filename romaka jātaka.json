[["V","Romaka Jātaka：v．l．Pārāpata．The Bodhisatta was once born its king of a flock of pigeons．For a long time they visited regularly a good ascetic in a cave near by，until，one day，he left and his place was taken by a sham ascetic．The pigeons continued their visits，till one day the villagers served the ascetic with a dish of pigeon’s flesh，and he，liking the flavour，conceived the desire to kill the pigeons．The Bodhisatta，suspecting his intentions，warned his followers and charged the ascetic with hypocrisy．J．ii．382 4； cp．Godha Jātaka （No．325）．"]]
