He was in the habit of holding a hunt once in seven days to keep his army in trim. One day when he was hunting，the quarry escaped from where the king lay in wait and，according to custom，it became the king’s duty to capture it. He，therefore，followed the animal for three leagues，killed it and，having cut it in half，carried it in a pingo. On his way back he happened to pass under the banyan tree which was the abode of the Yakkha ālavaka. The Yakkha had been granted a boon by the Yakkha-king，which allowed him to eat anybody who came within the shadow of the tree. Accordingly，he seized the king，but later released him on obtaining his promise that he would provide him at regular intervals with a human being and a bowl of food （SnA.i.217ff）. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the rest of the story see ālavaka Yakkha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2. ālavaka.\u003c/i\u003e-The \u003ci\u003eYakkha\u003c/i\u003e referred to above. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKing ālavaka，with the help of the Mayor of the town （Nagaraguttika） and his ministers，was able to keep his promise for some time，by sending criminals to the Yakkha. The Yakkha’s power was such that at the sight of him men’s bodies became as soft as butter. Soon there were no criminals left，and each household was forced to contribute one child for sacrifice to the Yakkha. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen women，about to bring forth children，began to leave the king’s capital. Twelve years passed in this manner and the only child left was the king’s own son，ālavaka Kumāra. When the king learnt this，he ordered the child to be dressed in all splendour and taken to the Yakkha. The Buddha，with his Eye of Compassion，saw what was going to happen and went to the Yakkha’s abode.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eālavaka was away at a meeting of the Yakkhas in Himavā. His doorkeeperGadrabha admitted the Buddha，after warning him of the Yakkha’s unmannerly nature. The Buddha went in and sat down on ālavaka’s throne while Gadrabha went to Himavā to announce to his master the Buddha’s arrival. While the Buddha was there，preaching to ālavaka’s women-folk，the Yakkhas Sātāgira andHemavata，passing through the air on their way to the assembly in Himavā，being made aware of the Buddha’s presence by their inability to fly over him，descended to ālavaka’s palace and made obeisance to the Buddha before resuming their journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen ālavaka heard from Gadrabha and from Sātāgira and Hemavata of the Buddha’s visit，he was greatly incensed and uttering aloud his name，he hurried to his abode. There with all the various supernatural powers he could command he tried to dislodge the Buddha from his seat，but without success even his special weapon，the Dussāvudha being of no avail against the Buddha. Then，approaching the Buddha，ālavaka asked him to leave his house，which the Buddha did. He then summoned the Buddha back and he came. Three times this happened and three times the Buddha obeyed，judging compliance to be the best way of softening his wrath，but the fourth time the Buddha refused to return. Thereupon ālavaka expressed his desire to ask questions of the Buddha，hoping thereby to fatigue him. The Buddha agreed，and when he had answered all the questions to ālavaka’s satisfaction，the latter became aSotāpanna （SnA.i.239）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt dawn of day，King ālavaka’s men brought the young prince，ālavaka-Kumara to the Yakkha，as sacrifice. Hearing the Yakkha’s shouts of joy at the close of the Buddha’s sermon，they greatly marvelled. When they announced to ālavaka that they had brought their offering，and handed him the child，he was much ashamed because of the Buddha’s presence. ālavaka gave the child to the Buddha，who blessed him and gave him back to the king’s messengers. The boy，having passed from the Yakkha’s hands to those of the Buddha，and from there to the king’s men，thereafter became known as Hatthaka ālavaka （SnA.i.239-40）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the king and the citizens heard that the Yakkha had become a follower of the Buddha，they built for him a special abode near that of Vessavana and provided him with endless gifts of flowers，perfumes，etc.，for his use. The story of ālavaka，of which the above is a summary，is given in full in SnA.i.217-40 and in SA.i.244-59. It is also given in brief in AA.i.211-12 and with some difference in detail. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eālavaka’s abode was thirty leagues from Sāvatthi，and the Buddha covered the whole journey in one day （SnA.i.220）. The abode was near a banyan tree and on the ground （bhummattham，） well protected with walls，etc.，and covered on the top by a metal net，it was like a cart enclosed on all sides. It was three leagues in extent，and over it lay the road to Himavā by air （SnA.i.222）. Ascetics，having seen the glittering palace，often called to find out what it was. ālavaka would ask them questions regarding their faith，and when they could not answer he would assume a subtle form and，entering their hearts，would drive them mad （SnA.i.228）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eālavaka shouted his name before starting from Himavā to vanquish the Buddha. He stood with his left foot on Manosilātala and his right on Kelāsakūta. His shout was heard throughout Jambudīpa and was one of the four shouts，mentioned in tradition，as having travelled so far （SnA.i.223； for the others see Punnaka，Vissakamma and Kusā）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eālavaka had a special weapon，the Dussāvudha，comparable to \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Sakka’s Vajirāvudha，  Vessavana’s Gadāvudha  Yama’s Nayanāvudha. It had the power，if it were thrown into the sky，of stopping rain for twelve years and if cast on the earth of destroying all trees and crops for a like period. If hurled into the sea it would dry up all the water，and it could shatter Sineru into pieces. It was made of cloth and is described as a vatthāvudha，and it was worn as a part of the Yakkha’s upper garment （uttariya）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three salient features in the story of ālavaka which link it closely to the large circle of stories grouped by Professor Watanabe （J.P.T.S.1909-10，pp.240ff） under the title of Kalmāsapāda stories：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  （1） The man-eating Yakkha；   （2） the captured king saving himself by a promise to provide the Yakkha   with offerings，and the sanctity of that promise； and   （3） the conversion of the Yakkha.The conversion of ālavaka is considered one of the chief incidents of the Buddha’s life （E.g.，J.iv.180； vi.329； Mhv.xxx.84）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eālavaka’s name appears in the Atānātiya Sutta，among the Yakkhas to whom followers of the Buddha should appeal for protection in time of need （D.iii.205）. （See also ālavaka Sutta.）\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e1. ālavaka Sutta.\u003c/i\u003e-Records the eight questions asked of the Buddha by ālavaka Yakkha and the answers given by the Buddha. It is said （SnA.i.228） that ālavaka’s parents had learnt the questions and their answers from Kassapa Buddha and had taught them to ālavaka in his youth； but he could not remember them and，in order that they might be preserved，he had them written on a gold leaf with red paint，and this he stored away in his palace. When the Buddha answered the questions he found that the answers were exactly the same as those given by Kassapa （SnA.i.231）. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sutta appears both in Sutta Nipāta （pp.31-3） and in the Samyutta Nikāya （i.213ff）. The ālavaka Sutta is also included in the collection of Parittas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2. ālavaka Sutta.\u003c/i\u003e-A conversation between the Buddha and Hatthaka ālavaka in which the Buddha states that he is among those who enjoy real happiness.
