While the Buddha was yet in Bhaddavatikā the Elder Sāgata went to the Jatila’s hermitage and took up his abode near the fireplace. The Nāga showed his resentment，but Sāgata was able to overcome him by means of his iddhi-powers. Later Sāgata visited the Buddha at Bhaddavatikā and went with him to Kosambī. The fame of the Elder’s victory over the Nāga had preceded him and the inhabitants of Kosambī were lavish in their hospitality to him.
