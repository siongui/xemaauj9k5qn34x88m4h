[["V","Kāmavilāpa Jātaka：The story is similar to that of the Puppharatta Jātaka．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the man stood impaled he looked up，and seeing a crow flying through the air，hailed him and sent a message to his wife，informing her where his possessions lay concealed and asking her to enjoy them （J．ii．443f； cp．Nos．34 and 216）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the introduction to the Jātaka it is said that the paccuppannavatthu is given in the Puppharatta Jātaka and the atītavatthu in the Indriya Jātaka．There seems to be an error here，for the first story of theIndriya Jātaka （J．iii．461ff） （unless another story is meant） bears no resemblance to the Kāmavilāpa Jātaka．"]]
