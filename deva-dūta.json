[["N","deva-dūta：'divine messengers'，is a symbolic name for old age，disease and death，since these three things remind man of his future and rouse him to earnest striving．In A．III，35，it is said：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e＂Did you，o man，never see in the world a man or a woman eighty，ninety or a hundred years old，frail，crooked as a gable-roof，bent down，resting on crutches，with tottering steps，infirm，youth long since fled，with broken teeth，grey and scanty hair，or baldheaded，wrinkled，with blotched limbs? And did it never occur to you that you also are subject to old age，that you also cannot escape it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e＂Did you never see in the world a man or a woman，who being sick，afflicted and grievously ill，and wallowing in their own filth，was lifted up by some people，and put down by others? And did it never occur to you that you also are subject to disease，that you also cannot escape it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e＂Did you never see in the world the corpse of a man or a woman，one or two or three days after death，swollen up，blue-black in colour，and full of corruption? And did it never occur to you that you also are subject to death，that you also cannot escape it?＂ - See M．130."]]
