[["N","āloka-saññā：＇perception of light＇. The recurring canonical passage reads：＂Here the monk contemplates the perception of light. He fixes his-mind to the perception of the day； as at day-time so at night，and as at night，so in the day. In this way，with a mind clear and unclouded，he develops a stage of mind that is full of brightness.＂ It is one of the methods of overcoming drowsiness，recommended by the Buddha to \u003ci\u003eMahā-Moggallāna \u003c/i\u003e（A. VII，58）. According to D. 33，it is conducive to the development of ＇knowledge and vision＇ （s. \u003ci\u003evisuddhi\u003c/i\u003e），and it is said to be helpful to the attainment of the ＇divine eye＇ （s. \u003ci\u003eabhiññā\u003c/i\u003e）."]]
