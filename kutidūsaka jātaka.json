[["V","Kutidūsaka Jātaka：A singila-bird，seeing a monkey shivering in the rain，suggested to him that he should build a nest．The monkey，in envy，destroyed the bird’s nest．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a novice Ulunkasaddaka，who had burnt down Mahā-Kassapa’s hut in a forest near Rājagaha．At that time Mahā Kassapa had two novices，one serviceable and helpful and the other ill-behaved．Whatever was done by his comrade the latter would pretend that he himself had done it．One day，in exasperation，the good novice heated water for the Elder’s bath and then hid it in a back room，leaving only a little in the boiler．When the other novice saw the steam rising he informed the Elder that his bath was ready．When asked where was the water，he let a ladle down into the almost empty boiler and the ladle rattled．When the story became known he was nick-named Ulunkasaddaka （”Rattle-ladle”）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing found fault with on this and several other occasions，he bore the Elder a grudge，and one day，having set fire to the Elder’s hut，he ran away．Later he was born first as a peta and then in Avīci．This incident was reported to the Buddha by monks who came from Rājagaha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe monkey of the Jātaka is identified with the wicked novice．J．iii．71ff．"]]
