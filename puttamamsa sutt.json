[["V","Puttamamsa Sutt：The four kinds of food  material food，contact，will，and consciousness   and how they should be regarded．Material food should be eaten only to maintain existence，as parents might eat the flesh of their own son in the desert．Contact should be regarded as a cow with a sore hide   exposed always to creatures and insects who devour her．Will should be regarded as a pit of glowing coal； and consciousness as a robber，brought before the king and smitten with darts at morning，noon，and evening．S．ii．97 ff．"]]
