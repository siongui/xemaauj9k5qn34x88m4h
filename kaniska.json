[["V","Kaniska：Kaniska  The great Kusāna king of India，a renowned patron of Buddhism．His name is spelt as Kāniska in inscriptions．On coins it appears，in Greek script，as Kanérki，or in the genitive Kanerkou which some scholars read as Kanéshki and Kanéshkou．Kasmir tradition gives the variant Kanistha which become Kanit’a in Chinese．Alberuni refers to him as Kanik[1]．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are different theories regarding the nationality of Kaniska．It is widely accepted that he is of Yuch-chi origin．It is said that during the 2nd century B．C．the Yuch-chi，a Mongoloid nomadic tribe of Central Asia，was forced out of their pasture lands by their more powerful neighbours，the Hiung-nu．Being thus driven out they migrated westwards and in the course of their migration conquered the Wu sun tribe and settled down in the basin of the lli river．Here they were divided into two branches of which the minor branch （Siao-yueh-chi） deflected southwards and settled down along the Tibetan border while the major branch （Ta-yueh-chi） proceeded forwards，defeated the Sakas and settled down in the conquered territory．From there they were again expelled by the son of the dead Wu sun chieftain．Resuming their march，they finally occupied Bactria and Sogdiana and by about the 1st century B．C．gave up their nomadic habits and adopted a more settled life，Here they were divided into five groups of whom the Kusānas （Kueishuang） overpowered the rest and united the whole tribe under Kadphises I （i．e．，Kujula Kadphises） who captured some regions of North West India．He was succeeded by his son Kadphises II （i．e．，Wima Kadphises） who annexed further Indian territory．Kaniska，whos connection with Kadphises II is not known[2]，is said to have succeeded him[3]．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSten Konow and Fleet consider that Kaniska belonged to a separate clan of the Kusānas which originated from Khotan[4]．B．N．Puri[5] says that the Kusāna and the Yueh-chi are two different racial groups and that the former is of Iranian Saka stock while the latter is of Mongoloid origin．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  There is no consensus among scholars regarding the date of Kaniska．The  earliest and the latest dates assigned to his accession are 5 B．C．and 278  A．C．S Levi suggested 5 B．C．[6]  Fleet who places it in 58 B．C．also considers him to be the founder of the  Vikrama Samvat[7]．According to  Professor Van Lohuizen de Leeuw Kaniska acceded to the throne between 71-86  A．C．[8]     Cunningham places him in 80 A．C．[9]     Fergusson，Oldenberg，Rapson，Thomas，Banerji，Jayaswal，and later，even  Marshal and Levi place Kaniska in 78 A．C．and some of them regard him also  as the founder of the Saka era[10]． Vincent Smith，Sten Konow favours one of the two dates 120 or 128-29 A．C．[11]     Ghirshman suggests the date 144 A．C．which is endorsed by Benjamin Rowland  and B．N Puri[12]．The date put  forward by R．C．Majumdar is 248 A．C．[13]     D．R．Bhandarkar first suggested 278 A．C．but later adopted 128 A．C．[14]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Of these numerous dates the most widely accepted is 78 A．C．though some   modern scholars like Benjamin Rowland and B．N．Puri prefer the date 144 on the   ground that the latest archaeological discoveries made at Begram in   Afghanistan by Ghrishman add more weight to it．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The view put forward by Fleet，and supported by R．Otto Franke and J．  Kennedy，that Kaniska preceded the two Kadphises，is no longer held as valid[15]．  The excavation done at Taxila has shown that the coins of the Kaniska group of   the Kusāna kings were found in the upper （i．e．later） strata of earth while   those of the Kadphises group were in the lower （i．e．，earlier） strata．The   connection between Kadphises II and Kaniska is not known．However，the   evidence provided by the coin finds in which the coins of Kadphises II and   Kaniska were found together proves that they were close to each other in time．  It is plausible to hold that Kaniska succeeded Kadphises II after a short   interregnum[16]．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  It is quite certain that Kaniska succeeded to a fairly large kingdom of   Kadphises II．He expanded this kingdom by annexing more territory both in   India and in Central Asia．Inscriptions of Kaniska found at Kosam （Allahabad）[17]，   Sarnath[18]，Mathura[19]，  Sui-vihar （Bhavalpur）[20]，Zeda   （Und）[21]，Manikiala （Rawalpindj）[22]   and his coins，found in Bihar and Pātaliputta，suggest that he ruled over a   vast Indian territory[23]．  Chinese and Tibetan tradition record that he conquered Sāketa and Magadha and   carried off the eminent Buddhist scholar Asvaghosa[24]．  He also conquered Kashmir，Punjab and Sind．In Kashmir he erected numerous   monuments and founded a city called Kaniskapura，now represented by the   village Kanispor．Outside India his rule extended to Afghanistan，Bactria，  Kashgar，Khotan and Yarkand．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Though he seems to have cherished a marked preference for Kashmir he had   his capital at Purusapura，the modern Peshawar which lay in the main route   from Afghanistan to the Indus plain．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Kaniska was a renowned warrior．His most daring military feat is his   conquest of Kashgar，Yarkand and Khotan，which were dependencies of China，  Kadphises II is also said to have tried to accomplish this feat without   success and consequently had to pay tribute to China．Kaniska not only freed   his kingdom from this obligation，but also took away hostages from a   dependency of China[25]．Some   scholars are of opinion that on a previous occasion Kaniska，too，tasted   defeat at the hands of the Chinese general Pan-chao．[26]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Kaniska treated his hostages with utmost consideration，providing them with   places of residence suitable for each season．These hostages are said to have   resided in the Sha lo ka monastery probably situated in the hills of Kapisa   （modern Kafiristan） and in monasteries at Gandhāra and Eastern Punjab   （Cinabhukti）．[27]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Buddhist tradition describes Kaniska as a great patron of Buddhism   comparable to Asoka：Legends about his conversion closely resemble those of   Asoka，and it is probable that these legends were based on stories detailing   Asoka’s conversion．Tradition represents Kaniska，before his conversion to   Buddhism，as one who had no faith either in right or wrong and as a person who   did not pay any attention to Buddhism．It is also said that the immediate   cause of his conversion was the deep remorse he felt over the bloodshed in his   numerous wars．[28] Though this   tradition is based on facts it could be surmised that it was built up by the   Buddhists making Kaniska to emulate Asoka and show the ennobling influence of   Buddhism on him．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Epigraphical and numismatic records do not provide clear testimony   regarding his conversion and religion．Vincent Smith surmises[29]   that his coins show that his conversion to Buddhism did not take place until   he had been on the throne for some time．The finest and presumably the   earliest coins bear legends，Greek in both script and language，with images of   the sun and moon under the names Helios and Selene （spelt Saléné on the   coins）．On later issues，the Greek script is retained but the language is   Knotanese，while the reverse of the coins represents gods worshipped by   Greeks，Persians and Indians．[30]   The coins that bear the images of Sākyamuni are considered to be the latest．  Some Indian scholars think that if numismatic evidence proves anything，it is   only his eclecticism，or that his coins only depict the various forms of faith   prevailing in his vast empire．[31]   Despite attempts to adduce evidence to prove that he was not a Buddhist，the   testimony provided by the numerous monuments he has built，as well as his   association with the Buddhist Council held during his reign show that，even if   he was not a Buddhist，he was more bent towards Buddhism than towards any   other religion．An inscription found on a relic casket，too，is taken by some   scholars as evidence to establish that he favoured the Sarvāstivāda school of   Buddhism．[32]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Tradition records that Kaniska studied Buddhism in his leisure hours under   the guidance of Pārsva．Tradition also states that he carried off Asvaghosa   from Pātaliputra．[33] Even if   this story is not accepted it is plausible to hold that Kaniska and Asvaghosa   were contemporaries and that these two were associates．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Two eminent Buddhist scholars Vasumitra and Nāgārjuna too，are said to be   his contemporaries．[34] Buddhism   at that time was a force to reckon with，and despite the possibility that   Kaniska was doing his best to consolidate big vast empire； he adopted Buddhism   to keep abreast of the trends prevalent at the time．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  According to the Buddhist tradition the greatest service rendered to   Buddhism by Kaniska is his convening of the Buddhist Council during his reign．  There are different accounts of this council．The best known is that of  Hsuan-tsang．[35]   Paramārtha in his Life of Vasubandhu gives another version which，though   generally considered to be the same as that of Hsuan-tsang，contains different   information．[36] Tārānātha also   records an account，which，though confused，contains important information．It   is not relevant at present，to extract facts from these legendary accounts   which are confused and often discrepant．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  It is said that Kaniska，greatly puzzled by the conflicting teachings found   in different schools，suggested to Pārsva to summon a council of eminent monks   to obtain an authoritative disposition of the doctrine．There was some   difference of opinion among them as to the venue of the council and they   finally decided to hold it at the Kundalavana vihāra in Kashmir．[37]   Vasumitra was elected president with Asvaghosa as the Vice president．The   members，five hundred in all composed 100，000 stanzas of Upadesa Sāstra   explanatory of the canonical sutras，100，000 stanzas of Vinaya vibhāsā sastra   explanatory of the vinaya and 100，000 of Abhidharma vibhāsā sastra explanatory   of the Abhidharma．Kaniska is said to have caused these treatises to be   written on copper plates and enclosed them in stone boxes which he deposited   in a stūpa specially constructed for that purpose．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  It is not possible to form a clear idea about the work accomplished at the   Council．Some scholars think that the chief business of the Council was to   collect canonical texts，and to prepare commentaries of different schools of   Buddhism．[38]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Tradition seems to connect the rise of Māhānānana with Kaniska and with the   Buddhist Council held during his reign．[39]   The fact that this Council is recognised by the Mahānānists[40]   is also taken as evidence on this point．But a close scrutiny of the available   information regarding the Council as well as the Buddhist activities carried   out by Kaniska shows that this tradition cannot be relied upon．It is a fact   that Tārānātha observes that all kinds of Mahāyānist writing appeared at this   time and that the Theravādins raised no objection．But he neither clearly   states nor implies that Kaniska personally took any interest in promoting   Mahāyāna teachings，or that any Mahāyāna treatises were composed at that   Council．On the other hand，it is generally regarded that this Council was   exclusively a council of the Sarvāstivādins of northern India and that the   Mahāyānists did not take part in it．[41]   It is apparent that after holding this Council the Sarvāstivādin school of   Buddhism gained more importance than before．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Whatever the tradition is there is no reasonable ground to hold that   Kaniska was responsible for the rise and rapid spread of Mahāyānism and that   the Council held during his reign was a Mahāyāna Buddhist[42]   Council．It is plausible to hold that he was more bent towards Sarvāstivāda   teachings and this is established by the inscription on the relic casket．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Of the numerous stūpas he is said to have built，the most famous is the one   at Shah-ji-ki-Dheri near Peshawar．From the accounts of the Chinese travellers   of the fifth and seventh centuries it appears that it was one of the wonders   at the time．This stūpa is said to have been 130 metres in height，resting   upon a stone substructure 50 metres high，topped by an iron mast 10 metres   high with gilded metal discs．It is assumed that the original form of the   stūpa as it appeared in the days of Kaniska，looked quite different from the   form that could be reconstructed from the ruins．It is also believed that it   was rebuilt many times．[43]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  The reliquary enshrined in the Kaniska cetiya is also worthy of note．The   object is a round pyxis，made of an amalgum of precious metals．The lower hand   of the drum consists of representation in relief of garland bearing erotes and   Kusāna sovereign，identified by scholars as Kaniska，between the divinities of   the sun and moon； on the side of the lid is a flock of geese （hamsa）．To the   top of the cover are fastened free standing statuettes of the Buddha，flanked   by Indra and Brahmā．The most interesting feature of the object is the Greek   name of the maker，agesilas，the overseer of works at the Kaniska-caitya．The   inscription found on the reliquary also states that it was made ”for   acceptance of the teachers of the Sarvāstivādin school” and this is cited as   evidence to prove that Kaniska was an adherent of this school of Buddhism．[44]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  During Kaniska’s reign his empire was enriched through trade carried on   with countries outside India，especially with Rome and Asia Minor，and as such   he had the necessary resources to patronise the arts．Many scholars believe   that Gandhāra art attained its peak during his reign．[45]   Tradition which credits Kaniska with having built many stūpas，also seems to   support this contention．According to Benjamin Rowland ”The Art of Gandhāra   is，properly speaking； the official art of the Kushān emperor Kaniska and his   successors[46] （see also，  GANDHāRA）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Like Asoka，Kaniska also helped missionary activities．It was during his   reign that Buddhism spread and became firmly established in central and   eastern Asia．There are no records of any missionaries sent by him．But it is   accepted that under his patronage Buddhism greatly flourished and spread   throughout his vast empire．One writer has observed that ”there was ceaseless   missionary activity throughout his vast empire which extended from Madhyadesa   in India to Central Asia．A truly integrated Asian culture came into existence   at this time．．，”[47] Vincent   Smith[48] observes that the   legend regarding his death possibly may be founded on fact．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  A statue of Kaniska was discovered by Tokritila，in the village of Māt．In   this headless statue the king is represented with his right hand resting on a   mace and the left clamping the hilt of the sword．He is dressed in a tunic   reaching down to the knees，and held round the loins by a girdle．He wears   heavy boots with straps round the ankles．Though headless，an inscription   found on it proves conclusively that it represents Kaniska．[49] \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e
