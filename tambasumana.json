[["V","Tambasumana：He was once a minister of Saddhātissa．Having gone to Kottasāla on official business he gave to a monk the food prepared by the people for him．He was then born in Vallavāhagāma and was called Sumana．Later he entered the Order in Brāhmanārāma and became an arahant．A deity of a timbaru-tree provided him and 500 companions with food during the Brahmanatiya famine．Later，during their travels near Kandarājika，the monks，about to eat，had doubts regarding the time because the sun was hidden．Tambasumana threw a stone into the sky，and，making it shine like the sun，dispelled their doubts．The spot came to be called Manisūriya．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn another occasion，at Cullatavālagāma，he converted a whole river into ghee from the ford of Vālagāma-vihāra to Bhuttakatittha，a distance of two yojanas．Ras．ii．24f．"]]
