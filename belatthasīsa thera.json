[["V","Belatthasīsa Thera：An arahant，preceptor of Ananda．He was once afflicted with scurvy and his robes clung to him．The monks thereupon applied water to the robes，but when the Buddha heard of it he made a rule allowing necessary therapeutic measures （Vin．i．202，295f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt one time this Thera would lie in the forest where he kept a store of dried boiled rice．When he needed food，after samāpatti he would sprinkle water on the rice and eat it instead of going for alms．When this was reported to the Buddha，he blamed Belatthasīsa for storing up food and promulgated a rule forbidding this （Vin．iv．86）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dhammapada Commentary （DhA．ii．171），however，states that the offence was committed after the rule was laid down，and，because the food was stored，not because of greed but through lack of covetousness，the Buddha declared Balatthasīsa free from guilt．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelatthasīsa was a brahmin of Sāvatthi who had left the world under Uruvela Kassapa before the Buddha’s Enlightenment and was converted when Uruvela Kassapa became a follower of the Buddha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe had been a monk in the time of Padumuttara Buddha，but could achieve no attainment．He once gave a mātulunga fruit to Vessabhū Buddha （ThagA．i．67 ff．; Thag．vs．16）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably identical with Mātulungaphaladāyaka of the Apadāna．Ap．ii．446．"]]
