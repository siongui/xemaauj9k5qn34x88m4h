[["V","Kutumbariya：A monastery in Rohana．A novice living there was in the habit of getting two ladles of rice at the house of a Lambakanna in the district．It was a time of scarcity，and one day，seeing a guest in the house，he took only one ladleful．The Lambakanna was greatly pleased，and when he reported the matter to his friends and acquaintances，they gave the novice sixty meals in perpetuity．AA．ii．262．"]]
