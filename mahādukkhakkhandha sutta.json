[["V","Mahādukkhakkhandha Sutta：Some monks once visited a Paribbājakārāma near Sāvatthi and were told by the Paribbājakas that they，as well as the Buddha，understood how to transcend pleasures of sense，visible forms and feelings； what then was the difference between themselves and the Buddha．The monks repeated this to the Buddha，who said that none save himself knew the satisfaction，the perils，and the deliverance which attend pleasures of sense，etc．； he then proceeded to explain the pleasures of the senses，the perils that attend them，and the deliverance there from，which is to shed all desire and appetite therefore．It is the same with feelings．M．i．83ff．"]]
