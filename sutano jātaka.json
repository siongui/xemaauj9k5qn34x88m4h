[["V","Sutano Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once a poor householder，named Sutana，and supported his parents．One day the king of Benares went hunting，and，after chasing a deer，killed it，and was returning with the carcase when he passed under a tree belonging to the Yakkha Makhādeva，who，by the power conferred on him by Vessavana，claimed him as his food．The king was set free on condition that he sent one man daily to the Yakkha for food．As time went on，no one could be found to take rice to the Yakkha，because all knew what awaited them．Then the king offered one thousand，and the Bodhisatta，for the sake of his parents and against his mother’s wishes，consented to go．Before going he obtained from the king his slippers，his umbrella，his sword，and his golden bowl filled with rice．Sutana then approached the Yakkha’s tree，and，with the point of his sword，pushed the bowl of rice to him．The Yakkha then started talking to Sutana and was very pleased with him．Sutana exhorted him to give up his evil ways，and returned to Benares with the Yakkha，who was given a settlement at the city gate and provided with rich food．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the introductory story see the Sāma Jātaka．The Yakkha is identified with Angulimāla and the king with Ananda．J．iii．324f．"]]
