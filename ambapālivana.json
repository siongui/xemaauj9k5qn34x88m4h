But both the Buddha and the monks seem to have stayed there previously during their visits to Vesāli （thus according to D.ii.94 the Buddha was already in the grove before Ambapālī visited him； see also S.v.301，which must refer to an incident before the Buddha’s last tour，because Sāriputta was still alive）. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Buddha is stated to have preached three suttas in the grove，two of them being on the value of the satipatthānā （S.v.141ff）.
