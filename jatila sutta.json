[["V","Jatila Sutta：Once when Pasenadi was talking with the Buddha in the loggia outside the Migāramātupāsāda，there passed close by thirty-five ascetics of various denominations - Jatilas，Niganthas，etc．- and the king saluted them respectfully．Later，he asked the Buddha whether they were arahants or on the way to arahantship．The Buddha explained to him how hard it was for a layman，with all his encumbrances，to find an opportunity to learn the truth about arahants； much time and care and attention were necessary．The king agreed and mentioned how he gathered information through his spies．S．i．77f．"]]
