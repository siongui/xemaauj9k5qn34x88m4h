[["V","Suka Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once a parrot．When he grew old hits eyes became weak and he was looked after by his son．The son once discovered a special kind of mango on an island，and，having eaten of it himself，brought some home to his parents．The Bodhisatta recognized the mango and warned his son that parrots visiting that island were short lived．But the son took no heed，and one day，while flying back from the island，he fell asleep from weariness and was eaten by a fish．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a monk who died of over eating．The parrot is identified with him．J．ii．291-4．"]]
