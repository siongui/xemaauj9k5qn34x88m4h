[["V","Ubhatobhattha Jātaka：Once in a village of line-fishermen one of the men took his tackle and went with his little son to fish．A snag caught hold of his line，but the man，thinking it was a big fish，sent his son home to ask his mother to pick a quarrel with the neighbours in order to keep them occupied lest they should claim a share of his catch．When the boy had gone，the fisherman went into the water to drag the fish，but he struck against the snag and was blinded in both eyes．Moreover a robber stole his clothes from the bank and his wife was taken before the village chief and fined and beaten for quarrelling．The Bodhisatta who was a Tree-deva saw all this happen and drew a moral from it．The story was told in reference to Devadatta，who is identified with the fisherman，all his enterprises having come to grief．J．i．482-4．"]]
