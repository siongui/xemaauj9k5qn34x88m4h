[["V","Mātuposaka Sutta：A brahmin of Sāvatthi visits the Buddha and，  having told him that he supports his mother with food obtained from begging，  asks if his action is worthy．The Buddha declares his action to be very good   and one which will bring him birth in heaven．See also the  Sāma Jātaka．S．i．181．"]]
