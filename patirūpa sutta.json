[["V","Patirūpa Sutta：The Buddha was once staying in Ekasālā in Kosala，  and there preached to a large congregation．Māra warned the Buddha not to   teach，lest he should suffer both from the zeal of his supporters and the   anger of his opponents．The Tathāgatha is unmindful of both，answered the   Buddha．S．i．111．"]]
