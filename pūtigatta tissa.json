[["V","Pūtigatta Tissa：A young man of Sāvatthi，of good family．After he joined the Order an eruption broke out on him which covered his whole body with sores．His fellow monks，unable to look after him，abandoned him．When the Buddha discovered this，he boiled some water and washed Tissa with his own hands and cleaned and dried his garments．When Tissa felt comforted the Buddha preached to him，and Tissa became an arahant．In a past birth he had been a fowler and had killed many birds，of which he sometimes first broke the bones to prevent them from flying away．One day he had given alms to an arahant．DhA．i．319 ff．"]]
