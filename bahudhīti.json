[["V","Bahudhīti：A brahmin of the Bhāradvājagotta who had seven widowed daughters and was much in debt． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day he lost fourteen oxen，and，after searching for them for six days，he came across the Buddha in a forest tract．He spoke the praises of the Buddha’s freedom，unperturbed by the anxieties to which he himself was a prey for the Buddha had no nagging wife，no creditors，no vermin disturbing his sleep．The Buddha agreed with him，and he was so pleased with the Buddha’s words that he asked to be ordained．The Buddha ordained him （S．i．170f ）; the Commentary adds （SA．i．187ff），that he took the newly ordained to Pasenadi to whom he related what had happened．The king summoned the man’s creditors; and paid them off，and having sent for his wife and daughters he took them under his protection．The man soon after became an arahant．"]]
