[["V","Pannika Jātaka：A greengrocer of Benares had a pretty daughter who was always laughing．Before agreeing to give her in marriage，her father wished to test her virtue，lest she should bring disgrace on his name．He took her into the forest and whispered to her words of love．When she expressed her horror，he was convinced of her innocence and agreed to the marriage．The Bodhisatta was a Treesprite and witnessed the incident．The story was related to a greengrocer in Sāvatthi who treated his daughter in a similar way．He later visited the Buddha and told him the story．The characters were identical in both cases．J．i．411f．"]]
