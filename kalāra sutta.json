[["V","Kalāra Sutta：Kalārakhattiya tells Sāriputta of Moliya-Phagguna’s secession．Sāriputta says that Moliya-Phagguna did not find satisfaction in the Dhamma，and assures Kalāra that he himself has no doubts whatever either about the past or about the future．Kalāra reports this conversation to the Buddha，who sends for Sāriputta and asks him a series of questions．The Buddha praises his answers，but Sāriputta confesses to his colleagues later that he felt nervous over the first question，but when the Buddha accepted his answer to that he recovered his confidence．S．ii．50ff．"]]
