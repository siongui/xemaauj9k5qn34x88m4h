[["V","Pārāpariya Thera：An arahant．He was the son of a very eminent Brahmin ofSāvatthi，and was so called because the name of his family was Pārāpara．One day he went to Jetavana to hear the Buddha preach，and the Buddha，seeing him，preached the Indriyabhāvanā Sutta．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis probably refers to M．iii．298ff．，which deals with the views of the Brahmin teacher Pārāsariya，and then gives the method of developing theindriyas as taught in the Ariyan Vinaya．The Sutta，however，was preached at Kajañgalā and not at Sāvatthi，the questioners being Uttara，a pupil of Pārāsariya，and Ananda．See Brethren 295，n．1．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter learning the Sutta，Pārāpariya pondered on its meaning and won arahantship （Thag．vs．726ff．； ThagA．ii．17f）．The Theragāthā contains a number of verses （Vs．920 49； ThagA．ii．74ff） spoken by Pārāpariya after the Buddha’s parinibbāna and immediately before his own death．"]]
