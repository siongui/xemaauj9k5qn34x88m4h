[["V","Cetiya Sutta：The Buddha goes with Ananda on his begging round in Vesāli and，after the meal，rests at the Cāpāla Cetiya．There the Buddha sings the praises of Vesāli and declares that，if he would，he could live for a whole kappa．Ananda does not act on the hint．When Ananda leaves him，Māra asks that the Buddha should die，as his disciples have been fully trained．The Buddha agrees，and declares that he will die in three months time．S．v．258ff; the incident is also given in D．ii．102ff and Ud．vi．1．"]]
