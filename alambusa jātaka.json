[["V","Alambusa Jātaka：Isisinga，son of the Bodhisatta and of a doe，who had drunk water into which the Bodhisatta’s semen had fallen，lived the ascetic life like his father. He had been warned by his father about the wiles of women，and lived in the forest practising the most severe austerities. By virtue of the power of these austerities，Sakka’s abode trembled，and Sakka，fearing his rivalry，sent down a beautiful celestial nymph，Alambusā，to tempt him and despoil him of his virtue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis she succeeded in doing，and for three years he lay unconscious in her embrace. At last，realising what had happened，he forthwith forsook sensual desire，and developing mystic meditation，attained to jhāna. Alambusā pleaded for forgiveness，which was readily granted. The story was related in reference to the temptation of a monk by the wife he had had during his lay life （J.v.152-61. See also the Nalinikā Jātaka （v.193f.） where Isisinga is tempted by Nalinikā）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Digha Nikāya Commentary （ii.370； see also Sp.i.214. Cp. the story of Rsyasrnga in the Ramayana i.9. The story is found in the Bharhut Tope，see Cunningham，CSB.29，P1.15） the name of the ascetic is given as Migasingi，and the story is quoted as an instance of a wrong explanation of the cessation of consciousness."]]
