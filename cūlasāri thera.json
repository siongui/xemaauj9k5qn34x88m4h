[["V","Cūlasāri Thera：A co-resident of Sāriputta．He evidently understood medicine，and one day he administered medical treatment for a sick person，in return for which he received a portion of choice food．As he went out he met an Elder on the road to whom he offered it，telling him the circumstances in which it was obtained and offering to bring him in the future the food so obtained．The Elder listened，then walked away without a word．When the Buddha heard of this，he declared that a shameless man can，in a manner of speaking，live happily，like a crow．Dh A.iii.351f."]]
