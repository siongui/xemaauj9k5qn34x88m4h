[["V","Āgantuka Sutta：Like to a guest-house into which come folk from all quarters to take up their residence，a monk，who develops the Noble Eightfold Path，realises those states （the five upādānakkhandhā） that should be realised，abandons those （aviijā and bhavatanhā） that should be abandoned and cultivates samatha and vipassanā. S.v.51-2."]]
