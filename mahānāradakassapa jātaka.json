[["V","Mahānāradakassapa Jātaka：Angati，king ofMithilā in Videha，is a good ruler．One full moon night he consults his ministers as to how they shall amuse themselves．Alāta suggests new conquests； Sunāma suggests that they shall seek pleasure in dance，song and music； but Vijaya recommends that they shall visit some samana or brahmin．Angati falls in with the views of Vijaya，and in great state goes to Guna of the Kassapagotta，an ascetic who lives in the park near the city．Guna preaches to him that there is no fruit，good or evil，in the moral life； there is no other world than this，no strength，no courage； all beings are predestined and follow their course like the ship her stern．Alāta approves of the views of Guna； he remembers how，in his past life，he was a wicked councillor called Pingala； from there he was born in the family of a general，and now he is a minister．A slave，Bījaka，who is present，can remember his past life and says he was once Bhavasetthi in Sāketa，virtuous and generous，but he is now the son of a prostitute．Even now he gives away half his food to any in need，but see how destitute he is!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngati is convinced that Guna’s doctrine is correct，and resolves to find delight only in pleasure．He gives orders that he shall not be disturbed in his palace； Candaka，his minister，is deputed to look after the kingdom．Fourteen days pass in this manner．Then the king’s only child，his beloved daughterRujā，comes to him arrayed in splendour，attended by her maidens，and asks for one thousand to be given the next day to mendicants．Angati protests； he will deny his daughter no pleasure or luxury，but has learnt too much to approve of her squandering money on charity or wasting her energy in keeping the fasts．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRujā is at first amazed，then tells her father that his councillors are fools，they have not taken reckoning of the whole of their past，but remember only one birth or two； they cannot therefore judge．She herself remembers several births； in one she was a smith in Rājagaha and committed adultery，but that sin remained hidden，like fire covered with ashes，and she was born as a rich merchant’s only son in Kosambī．There she engaged in good works，but，because of previous deeds，she was born after death in the Roruva-niraya and then as a castrated goat in Bhennākata．In her next birth she was a monkey，and then an ox among the Dasannas； then a hermaphrodite among the Vajjians，and later a nymph inTāvatimsa．Once more her good deeds have come round，and hereafter she will be born only among gods and men．Seven births hence she will be a male god in Tāvatimsa，and even now the god Java is gathering a garland for her．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll night she preaches in this way to her father，but he remains unconvinced．The Bodhisatta is a Brahmā，named Nārada Kassapa，and，surveying the world，sees Rujā and Angati engaged in conversation．He therefore appears in the guise of an ascetic，and Angati goes out to greet and consult him．The ascetic praises goodness，charity，and generosity，and speaks of other worlds．Angati laughs，and asks for a loan which，he says，he will repay twice over in the next world，as the ascetic seems so convinced that there is one．Nārada tells him of the horrors of the hell in which Angati will be reborn unless he mends his ways，and mentions to him the names of former kings who attained to happiness through good lives．The king at last sees his error and determines to choose new friends．Nārada Kassapa reveals his identity and leaves in all majesty．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to the conversion ofUruvela Kassapa．He came，after his conversion，with the Buddha to Latthivana，and the people wondered if he had really become a follower of the Buddha．He dispelled their doubts by describing the folly of the sacrifices which he had earlier practised，and，laying his head on the Buddha’s feet did obeisance．Then he rose seven times into the air，and，after having worshipped the Buddha，sat on one side．The people marvelled at the Buddha’s powers of conversion，which，the Buddha said，were not surprising since he possessed them already as a Bodhisatta．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAngati is identified with Uruvela Kassapa，Alāta with Devadatta，Sunāma with Bhaddiya，Vijaya with Sāriputta，Bījaka with Moggallāna，Guna with the Licchavi Sunakkhatta，and Rujā with Ananda．J．vi．219 55； see also J．i．83．"]]
