[["V","Aggika Sutta：Preached by the Buddha to Aggika-Bhāradvāja （2）. The brahmin exalts the knowledge of the three Vedas. The Buddha tells him that a mere babbling of Vedic runes does not make a brahmin of a man who is defiled within and is deceitful. He should have knowledge of former lives，of other worlds and of the higher lore （abhiññā） that gives cessation of birth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAggika-Bhāradvāja offers the Buddha the prepared meal as a fee for his teaching，but the Buddha rejects it because ”the Buddhas do not accept wages.” The brahmin should，if he so desire，extend his hospitality to him for his holiness，and not for his ability to chant verses. S.i.166-7."]]
