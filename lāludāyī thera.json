[["V","Lāludāyī Thera：An Elder who possessed the knack of saying ”the wrong thing．” He would go to a place where people were enjoying a holiday and recite stanzas suitable to a funeral and vice versa （DhA．iii．123ff）．When the Buddha heard of this he related the Somadatta Jātaka，showing that in past births，too，Lāludayī had possessed the same propensity．He is identified with the foolish father （Agnidatta） of the story （J．ii．167； DhA．iii．125）．We also read of his jealousy of the praises bestowed on Sāriputta andMoggallāna for their knowledge and exposition of the Law，and he claimed that he possessed knowledge equal to theirs．But one day when asked to preach，he sat on a seat holding a painted fan，but found nothing to say．He thereupon agreed to preach in the evening； but the same thing happened，and he barely escaped with his life，so furious was his audience．The Buddha，on hearing of this，related theSūkara Jātaka （in which Lāludāyī was the pig），showing that in the past，too，he had covered himself with disgrace because of his boastfulness．J．ii．344ff．； but according to the introductory story of the Jātaka itself （in J．ii．9ff．），Lāludāyī’s name is not mentioned，and the incident described differs somewhat．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn another occasion，he had a dispute withDabba Mallaputta regarding the allotment of the rice tickets，and the monks，in order to teach him a lesson，handed him the tickets to distribute．But he created such confusion that there was a great uproar，and Ananda was sent by the Buddha to find out what was happening．When Amanda returned with this story，the Buddha related the Tandulanāli Jātaka to show that in the past Lāludāyī had been a foolish appraiser （J．i．123ff）．TheNangalīsa Jātaka gives another example of his folly and ineptitude （J．i．446ff）； so does also thePadañjali Jātaka （J．ii．263f），where he is identified with Padañjali，an idle，lazy loafer．In theMahāummagga Jātaka （J．vi．478） he is identified with the somewhat foolish king，Vedeha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLāludāyī once had a discussion with Pasūra，who，at first，thought him to be clever and wise，and accepted him as teacher，being ordained by him．But，later，Pāsura easily defeated him in discussion （SNA．ii．540）．Others，too，visiting Jetavana，and seeing him in the Preacher’s seat，mistook him for an eminent Elder，but soon discovered their mistake （E．g．，DhA．ii．31）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn one occasion （A．iii．192f．； AA．ii．628） Lāludāyī even dared to contradictSāriputta regarding birth among the manomayadevā ??．Three times Sāriputta repeated his statement and three times Lāludāyī contradicted him，and，there being no monk in the assembly who supported Sāriputta，he took Lāludāyī to the Buddha，where he three times repeated the same statement，being three times contradicted．Then the Buddha called Lāludāyī ”a witless fool” and silenced him．Ananda was witness to the dispute，but took no part in it，thereby winning the Buddha’s censure．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eElsewhere （A．iv．414f．； AA．ii．810），however，we find Lāludāyī listening in all humility to a discourse by Sāriputta on Nibbāna，as the happiness which is not sensed （avedayitasukha）．Though Udāyī’s knowledge of the Dhamma was not profound，he did not hesitate to take part in a discussion，even with the Buddha himself，when occasion arose．We find him twice censured by the Buddha for this exhibition of his ignorance，once in the Mahākamma vibhanga Sutta （M．iii．208） and once again in a discussion on anussati （A．iii．322f）．In both instances Ananda is present，and，in the discussion on anussati，he earns the Buddha’s praise for his knowledge compared with Udāyī’s ignorance．This annoyed Udāyī，for we find him confronting Ananda with the fact that though he had been in the constant society of the Buddha he had not profited by it，a remark which earned the censure of the Buddha and his assurance that Ananda would certainly reach perfection in that very life （A．i．228； AA．i．441）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa （ThagA．ii．7； some of the MSS．read nātakācariyaputta ） calls Lāludāyī Kovariyaputta．It is not clear whether this means that his father was called Kovariya．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Vinaya （Vin．iii．110） mentions a monk called Udāyī who was a colleague ofSeyyasaka．He persuaded Seyyasaka to commit the first Sanghādisesa offence，saying that he himself acted likewise．For this the Mānatta penalty was imposed on him．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Commentaries，（Sp．iii．517； DhA．iii．5） this Udāyī is to be identified with Lāludāyī，and if this be correct，it was perhaps the same monk who was guilty of several Vinaya offences attributed to Udāyi - seeUdāyi （2） - though the Vinaya Commentary does not elsewhere （E．g．，Sp．iii．541，549，552，where he is simply called Udāyi） definitely so identify him，except once （Sp．iv．804），where he is mentioned as having made an embroidered robe for a nun，which he persuaded her to wear in the assembly of the nuns! Was this because the Commentator regarded the two Udāyis as distinct persons? （E．g．，MA．i．348）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLāludāyī is given as an example of a person who did no good either to himself or to others （neva attahitāya patipanno no parahitāya）．Buddhaghosa elsewhere （Sp．iii．517） describes him as “bhantamigasappatibhāgo niddārāmatādim anuyuttānam aññataro lolabhikkhu．”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e1．Lāludāyīthera Vatthu\u003c/i\u003e．The story of Lāludāyī’s past life as Aggidatta （DhA．iii．123ff）．Cp．the Somadatta Jātaka．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Lāludāyīthera Vatthu\u003c/i\u003e．The story of Lāludāyī’s futile attempt to excel Sāriputta andMoggallāna in the power of preaching．DhA．iii．344ff．"]]
