[["V","Pangura vihāra：A monastery in Hatthibhogajanapada in the south of Ceylon．In front of its refectory stood a pangura tree．One day the devatā of the tree heard a novice recite the Mahādhammasamādāna Sutta and applauded the recital．On being questioned by the novice，he told him that he had heard the Buddha preach the sutta but had been unable to see him，there being so many deities present more important than himself．It is said that the devatā became a sotāpanna on the very day of this conversation．MA．i．530f．"]]
