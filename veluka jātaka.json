[["V","Veluka Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once at the head of five hundred hermits，one of whom had a pet viper which was called Veluka，because it was kept in a bamboo．The Bodhisatta warned the ascetic against the snake，but his warning was unheeded．The hermit thus came to be called Velukapitā．One day the hermits went into the forest and were away for a few days，and when Velukapitā touched the viper on his return，the animal，hungry and angry，bit him，and he fell down dead．The story was told in reference to a headstrong monk who is identified with Velukapitā．J．i．245f．\t"]]
