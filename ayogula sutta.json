[["V","Ayogula Sutta：Ananda asks the Buddha if the Buddha can，by psychic powers，reach the Brahma world in his mind-made body as well as in his physical body．The Buddha says he can，and proceeds to explain how by concentrating body in mind and mind in body the body becomes radiant and plastic．Like an iron ball heated throughout the day，or a tuft of cotton seed on a ball of thistledown，wafted lightly on the wind，so the body，at such time，rises from the ground into the air and takes on manifold forms of magic power （S．v．282-4）．"]]
