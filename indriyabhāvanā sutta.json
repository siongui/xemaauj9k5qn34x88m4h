[["V","Indriyabhāvanā Sutta：Preached at Kajangalā in theMukheluvana．When a young brahmin，Uttara，pupil of Pārāpariya，visits theBuddha，the Buddha asks him what was the teaching of Pārāsariya on the development of the indriyas．It is that a man should neither see forms with his eyes，nor hear words with his ears，says Uttara．Whereupon the Buddha retorts that in that case the deaf and the blind have reached development．When Uttara sits silent and discomfited，Ananda intervenes and begs the Buddha to expound his teaching on the subject．The Buddha agrees and preaches this Sutta，with a variety of similes （M．iii．298-302）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Theragāthā Commentary （ii．17） we are told that theThera Pārāpariya （probably identical with Pārāsariya mentioned above） was taught the Indriyabhāvana Sutta by the Buddha．He learnt it by heart，and pondering over its meaning，attained insight．TheTheragāthā （vv．726ff） gives a summary of the musings of Pārāpariya which lead to his attainment．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only connection between the Sutta and this summary is identity of subject，not identity of treatment．Perhaps Pārāpariya’s musings were only prompted by the Sutta and were independent of its actual words．"]]
