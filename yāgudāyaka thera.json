[["V","Yāgudāyaka Thera：An arahant．Thirty thousand kappas ago，while on his way home laden with gifts，he found the river impassable and took his evening meal at a monastery．There he was pleased with the demeanour of the monks and gave them a meal of gruel with five savouries （? pañcanna yāgu）．After death，he was born in Tāvatimsa，and was king of gods thirty three times and king of men thirty times．Ap．ii．375f．\t"]]
