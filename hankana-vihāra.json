[["V","Hankana-vihāra：A monastery in Ceylon，where lived an old Thera who   believed himself to be an arahant．Dhammadinna of Talangara （q.v.） asked him   to create an elephant and make it approach him．This he did，but was so scared   at the sight that he knew his mistake regarding his attainment，and asked   pardon of Dhammadinna．MA.i.150."]]
