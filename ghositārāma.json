Could it be said of a follower of the Buddha that his attainments depend on the length of time during which he has observed the Buddha’s teachings? Once Ananda visits （A.iv.37f），at her request，a nun living near by reported to be ill and enamoured of him．The mere sight of him causes her recovery，but he preaches to her on the impermanent nature of the body and makes her realise the truth （A.ii.144f）．Among those who visit Ananda at the Ghositārāma and discuss various matters with him are mentioned：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Ghosita （S.iv.113）， Unnābha （S.v.271f.），a householder，follower   of the Ajivikas （A.i.217f.），and Bhaddaji   （A.iii.202）．Udāyī twice visits him there，once   to ask for a description of consciousness （S.iv.169f.），and again to quote a   verse uttered by Pañcālacanda devaputta and to ask Ananda to explain it   （A.iv.449）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe find him also joining in a discussion which ensued on a sermon to the monks by Ananda （A.iv.426f.）．Udāyī preached to large audiences at the Ghositārāma and was evidently appreciated，for we find Ananda reporting it to the Buddha and being told that it is no easy matter to preach to a large assembly with acceptance （A.iii.184f.）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Yuganaddha Sutta is a discourse preached by Ananda to the monks at the Ghositārāma of his own accord （A.ii.156f.）．Channa is several times mentioned in connection with incidents taking place at the Ghositārāma．Mention has already been made of the ukkhepa-niyakamma declared on him．A devoted householder，wishing to build a vihāra for him，asked him for a site．Vin.iii.155f； mention is made of other misdemeanours which he committed in order to have a fine vihāra （Vin.iv.47）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChanna started cutting down trees and other things，in order to clear the site，and this led to great uproar．On another occasion he is reported to the Buddha for refusing to listen to his colleagues and the Buddha chides him （Vin.iii.77，also iv.35f，113．See also S.iii.132f）．It was when Channa was at the Ghositārāma that Ananda came，at the bidding of the monks，to inflict on him the brahmadanda （Vin.ii.292）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong others mentioned as staying at the Ghositārāma areMūsila，Savittha，Nārada，in the company of Ananda （S.ii.115），Pindola Bhāradvāja - who convertsUdena when the latter comes to see him （S.iv.110f.） and earns the Buddha’s praises for his attainments （S.v.224） -Sāriputta and Upavāna （S.v.76），and Bāhiya andAnuruddha （A.ii.239）．Anuruddha is there at the time of the schism of the Kosambī monks but refuses to intervene．He indulges，instead，in his powers of clairvoyance and mention is made of a visit paid to him by the Manāpakāyika-devas （A.iv.262f）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDāsaka and a number of other monks were once staying in the Ghositārāma； on learning that Khemaka lies ill in the Badarikārāma，one gāvuta away，the others send Dāsaka several times to and fro to ask various questions of Khemaka．In the end，Khemaka himself comes to them to solve their difficulties （S.iii.126f）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee also following Suttas and Jātakas，all preached while the Buddha was staying at the Ghositārāma：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Kosambiya Sutta  Jāliya Sutta  Sandaka Sutta  Upakkilesa Sutta  Sekha Sutta  Dalhadhamma Jātaka  Kosambī Jātaka  Suripāna JātakaThirty thousand monks from the Ghositārāma，under the leadership of Urudhammarakkhita，were present at the foundation of theMahā Thūpa atAnurādhapura．Mhv.xxix.34."],["K","ghositārāma：ဃောသိတာရာမ\t（ပု）\u003cbr\u003e  [ဃောသိတ+အာရာမ]\u003cbr\u003e  \tဃောသိတသူဌေး၏ အရာမ်ကျောင်း၊ ဃောသိတ သူဌေး-ဃောသကသူဌေး-ဆောက်လုပ်အပ်သော ကျောင်းတိုက်၊ ဃောသိတာရုံကျောင်း။"],["R","ghositārāma：ဃောသိတာရာမ\t（ပ） （ဃောသိတ+အာရာမ）\u003cbr\u003eဃောသိတာရုံကျောင်း။ ကောသမ္ဗီပြည်၌ ဃောသိတသူဌေးဆောက်သော ကျောင်း။ "]]
