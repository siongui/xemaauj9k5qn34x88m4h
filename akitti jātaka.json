This man invited the Buddha，and during seven days gave many gifts to him and to the monks. On the last day he presented the company of arahants with all necessaries. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Buddha praised the man’s generosity and told him how wise men of old shared their possessions with others，even when they themselves had nothing to eat but kāra-leaves and water.
