[["V","Mahāpaduma Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once born as Mahāpaduma，son of Brahmadatta，king of Benares．When Paduma’s mother died，his father took another wife．On one occasion the king had to leave the city to quell a border rising，and，thinking the dangers too great to take his queen with him，he entrusted her to the care of Paduma．The campaign was victorious．In the course of making arrangements for the celebration of his father’s return，Paduma entered the queen’s apartments．She was struck by his amazing beauty，and fell in love with him，inviting him to lie with her．On his indignant refusal，she feigned illness，and，on the return of the king，falsely accused him of having ill treated her．The king gave orders，in spite of the protestations of the people，that Paduma should be thrown from the ”Robbers’ Cliff．” The deity of the mountain saved his life and entrusted him to the care of the Nāga king，who took him to his abode，where he stayed for one year．Paduma then went to the Himālaya and became an ascetic．The king heard of this and went to offer him the kingdom，but it was refused by Paduma．The king，convinced of the falsity of the charge brought against Paduma，caused the queen to be flung from the Robbers’ Cliff．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to Ciñcamānavikā’s false accusations against the Buddha．Ciñcā was the wicked queen，Devadatta the king，Sāriputta the deity，and Ananda the Nāga．J．iv．187 96； DhA．iii．181ff．"]]
