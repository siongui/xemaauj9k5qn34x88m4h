[["V","Dhammavādi Sutta：Sāriputta says，in answer to a question by Jambukhādaka，that those who preach the doctrine of abandoning lust and hatred and illusion are real preachers．To be able to do this，they must practise the doctrine which they preach，and the method of such practice is the Ariyan Eightfold Path．S.iv.252； cp.261f."]]
