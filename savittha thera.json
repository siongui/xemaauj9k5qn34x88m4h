[["V","Savittha Thera：In the Anguttara （A．i．118f） he is represented as saying，in the course of a conversation between him，Sāriputta andKotthita，that he preferred the person who obtains relief by faith （saddhā），to one who testifies to the truth with the body or one who has won view．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Commentary （AA．i．353） explains that Savittha himself won arahantship through faith，and that therefore he praises faith．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Samyutta （S．ii．115） contains two conversations of Savittha，both of which took place at the Ghositārāma inKosambī．The first is withMūsila and deals with thepaticcasamuppāda．Musīla，in answer to Savittha’s questions，says that he has realized the truth of the paticcasamuppāda as his very own．”Then you are anarahant，” says Savittha，and Musīla remains silent．In the other conversation，Nārada，present at the discussion，in the company of Ananda，requests that the same questions be put to him．This Savittha does，and he tells Savittha that he has realized the truth of the Paticcasamuppāda by right insight and that，yet，he is not an arahant．He is like a man who sees a well containing water，but who has neither rope nor vessel．”Now，what will you say of Nārada?” asks Ananda．”Nothing that is not lovely and good，” answers Savittha．"]]
