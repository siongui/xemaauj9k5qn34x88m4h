[["V","Pakudhanagara：A city，evidently in Burma，once the centre of great   literary activity．See Gv．65； but elsewhere （Gv．67），the works attributed to   the residents of Pakudhanagara are stated to have been written in Kañcipura．  See also Gv．75，where reference is made to a Makuranagara，v．l．Pakuta．  Perhaps this is the same as Pakudha．"]]
