[["V","Kesaputtiya Sutta：A group of suttas preached to the Kālāmas of Kesaputta．There need be no official tradition，no authority，no subtle reasoning or the like，in order to ascertain the true doctrine and distinguish it from the false．The noble disciple whose mind is pure has four consolations．He knows that whether there be a next world or not his happiness is secure．A．i．188f．"]]
