[["V","Kukkutandakhādikā Vatthu：A girl eats the eggs of a hen，the hen conceives a grudge against her and is reborn as a cat，who eats the eggs of the hen，who is the girl reborn．For five hundred births they thus return hatred for hatred．Finally the girl is reborn in Sāvatthi as a woman，and the hen as an ogress．The ogress eats two of the woman’s children，and is about to eat the third when the woman seeks refuge in the monastery．The Buddha admonished them to return good for evil and they become friends．DhA．iii．449f； cp．the story of Kālī （6）．"]]
