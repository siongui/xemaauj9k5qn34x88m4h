[["V","Sussondī Jātaka：Tamba was a king of Benares and his wife was the beautiful Sussondī．Nāgadīpa was then known as Seruma，and the Bodhisatta was a young Garuda living there．He used to go in disguise to Benares and play at dice with Tamba．The queen heard of his beauty and contrived to see him，and they fell in love with each other．The Garuda，by his power，raised a storm in the city and covered it with darkness，under cover of which he carried off Sussondī．The king was filled with grief，not knowing what had happened to his queen，as the Garuda continued to play at dice with him．Tamba therefore sent Sagga，a minstrel，to search for her．In the course of his wanderings，Sagga came to Bhārukaccha and took ship for Suvannabhūmi．In the middle of the ocean the sailors asked Sagga to play for them，but Sagga told them that his music would excite the big fish and trouble would ensue．The sailors，however，insisting，Sagga played，and the fish，maddened by the sound，splashed about，and the ship broke in two under the leap of a sea-monster．Sagga lay on a plank，which drifted to Nāgadīpa．There he saw and was recognized by Sussondī．Sussondī took him home，and，keeping him hidden from the Garuda，enjoyed herself with him when the Garuda was away playing at dice．Six weeks later a ship，with merchants for Benares，touched at Nāgadīpa，and Sagga returned home．He found Tamba playing at dice with the Garuda and recounted his adventures in song．The Garuda heard the song and understood the references．Filled with remorse that he had not been able to keep his wife，he brought her back to Tamba．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to a love sick monk．Ananda is identified with Tamba．J．iii．187-90．"]]
