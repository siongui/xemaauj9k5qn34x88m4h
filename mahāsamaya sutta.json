[["V","Mahāsamaya Sutta：\u003ci\u003e1．Mahāsamaya Sutta．\u003c/i\u003e Preached at Mahāvana in Kapilavatthu，where the Buddha was staying with five hundred arahants．The gods of the ten thousand world systems had come to visit the Buddha and the monks，and were joined by four gods from the Suddhāvāsā，who saluted the Buddha in verse．The Buddha then addressed the monks and recited this sutta （D．ii．253-62）．It is possible to divide the discourse into three parts．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first contains a list of the devas and other beings present to worship the Buddha．It is a long list of strange names given in verses，mostly doggerel．Many of the beings mentioned are to us now mere names，with no special information attached．Most of them were probably local deities，the personification of natural phenomena，guardian spirits，fairies，harpies，naiads，dryads，and many others，who are here represented as adherents of the Buddha，come to do him honour．It is noteworthy that even the most important gods -  e．g．，Soma，Varuna and Brahmā -  are only incidentally mentioned，added to the list，as it were，without special distinction．A similar list of devas is found in the Mahavastu （i．245； iii．68，77）； the addition of Siva to this list is significant．The list of gods given in the Mahāsamaya should be compared with that given in the Atānātiya Sutta．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second part of the sutta is the framework of the words attributed to the Buddha，introducing the list of devas，giving the Buddha’s warning to the monks to beware of Māra and Māra’s declaration that he had no power over them as arahants are free from fear．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third part of the sutta may be called the prologue，the verses of greeting spoken by the devas from Suddhāvāsā （Rhys Davids，Dial．ii．282f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis prologue is elsewhere preserved as a separate episode （S．i．27）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Commentaries give long accounts of the preaching of the Mahāsamya （E．g．，SNA．357ff．； DA．ii．672ff）．The arahants mentioned are Sākiyan and Koliyan youths，representatives of Sākiyan and Koliyan families，sent to join the Order as a sign of gratitude to the Buddha for having averted the quarrel between the two families regarding the water of the Rohinī．On that occasion the Buddha had preached to the opposing armies the Attadanda Sutta and the Phandana，Latukika and Vattaka Jātakas （DA．ii．674 adds the Pathavuddriyana and the Rukkhadhamma Jātakas）．He then related the story of their origin，showing that both families were descended from a common stock．When the quarrel was thus settled，two hundred and fifty young men from each family entered the Order and the Buddha dwelt with them in Mahāvana．But the wives of the men tried to entice them back； the Buddha，therefore，took them to Himavā，where he preached to them the Kunāla Jātaka on the banks of the Kunāla Lake．At the conclusion of the sermon they attained to various fruits of the Path，from anāgāmī-phala to sotāpatti．He then returned with them to Mahāvana，where they developed insight and became arahants．They assembled to pay homage to their teacher on the evening of the full moon day of Jetthamāsa，and to the assembly came the devas of the ten thousand world systems．The Buddha told the monks the names of the devas present （as given in the Mahāsamaya），and，surveying the assembly，saw that it consisted of two kinds of beings，one capable of benefiting by his teaching （bhabbā），and the other not so capable （abhabbā）．The bhabbā，he saw，could be divided into six groups -  the rāgacaritā and the dosa moha vitakka saddhā buddhi caritā，according to temperament．To these，respectively，he preached six suttas，calculated to benefit each separate class，and，in order that each sutta might take the form of question and answer，he created a Buddha form to ask questions，while he himself answered them．The six suttas，so preached，were the Purābheda，Kalahavivāda，Cūlavyūha，Mahāvyūha，Tuvataka and Sammāparibbājaniya．Countless numbers of beings realized the Truth （AA．i．173，320； Mil．20，350； SNA．i．174）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe preaching of the Mahāsamaya Sutta was among the incidents of the Buddha’s life sculptured in the Relic Chamber of the Mahā Thūpa．Mhv．xxx．83．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Mahāsamaya Sutta．\u003c/i\u003eSee the Sammāparibbājaniya Sutta．"]]
