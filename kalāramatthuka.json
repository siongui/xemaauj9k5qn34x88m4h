[["V","Kalāramatthuka：A naked ascetic of Vesāli，held in high repute by the Vajjians．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe had taken seven vows：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  to wear no garments，  to be chaste，  to maintain himself only by spirituous drinks and flesh，  eating no rice or gruel，  never to go beyond the Udena shrine，the Gotamaka shrine，the Sattamba   shrine，and the Bahuputta shrine．Sunakkhatta once visited him and asked him questions，but Kalāramatthuka would not listen，and showed resentment at being interrogated．When Sunakkhatta reported this to the Buddha，the Buddha predicted that the ascetic would，before long，wear garments，be married，eat rice and gruel，go beyond the limits he had until now observed，and fall in fame．And so it came to pass．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e（D．iii．9ff）．v．l．Kandaramasuka，Kalāra，Kalāra-matthaka．"]]
