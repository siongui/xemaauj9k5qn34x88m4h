[["P","Pāṭī，（f．） [?] at VvA．321 in phrase sukka-pakkha-pāṭiyaṁ “in the moonlight half” is doubtful．Hardy in Index registers it as “part，half-，” but pakkha already means “half” and is enough by itself．We should probably read paṭipāṭiyaṁ “successively．” Note that the similar passage VvA．314 reads sukka-pakkhe pannarasiyaṁ．（Page 451）"]]
