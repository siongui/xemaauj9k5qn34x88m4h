[["V","Rajja Sutta：Once the Buddha was thinking compassionately of those suffering from the cruelty of rulers and wondering if it were possible to rule without causing suffering．Māra approaches and tries to make him absorbed in the fascination of exercising power，suggesting that if the Buddha wished he could change even the Himālaya into a mass of gold．But，says the Buddha，he has seen suffering and its source and will not，therefore，incline to sense desires．S．i．116．"]]
