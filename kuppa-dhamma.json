[["N","kuppa-dhamma，'liable to perturbation'，is one who has not yet attained  full mastery over the absorptions．In Pug．3 it is said：What person is liable to perturbation? Such a person gains the attainments of the fine-material and immaterial sphere （s．\u003ci\u003eavacara\u003c/i\u003e）．But he does not gain them at his wish，nor without toil and exertion； and not at his wish as regards place，object and duration，does he enter them or arise from them．Thus it is well possible that in case of such a person，through negligence，the attainments will become perturbed．This person is liable to perturbation．＂"]]
