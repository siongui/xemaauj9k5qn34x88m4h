[["V","Āyu Sutta：1．āyu Sutta．-Preached at the Kalandakanivāpa in Rājagaha．The Buddha tells the monks that human life is very brief and has its sequel elsewhere．Therefore good must be done and the holy life must be lived．Mars approaches the Buddha and suggests that men should take no heed of death，but should enjoy life like a babe replete with milk．The Buddha points out to him the error of such a view （S．i．108）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e 2．āyu Sutta．-Preached at the same place，on another occasion．Māra utters the same sentiment and the Buddha refutes his views．Māra retires vanquished．S．i．108-9．"]]
