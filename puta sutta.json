[["V","Puta Sutta：Tālaputa visits the Buddha and asks him if there be any truth in the tradition that stage actors are born，after death，among the Pahāsadevā．The Buddha refuses at first to answer the question，but，on being pressed，he says that the truth is that actors are born in the Pahāsa niraya．Tālaputa thereupon starts to weep to think that he should have been so long deceived．He enters the Order and，in due course，becomes an arahant．S．iv．306f．"]]
