[["V","Ambātakavana：A grove at Macchikāsanda，belonging toCittagahapati. Being pleased with the ElderMahānāma of Macchikāsanda，Citta invited him to a meal，and after listening to his discourse，gave the grove to the Order. At the dedication of the gift the earth trembled. Later he built a splendid monastery there，the Ambātakārāma，for the use of monks from all parts （AA.i.209； DhA.ii.74）. It became the residence of large numbers of monks，and discussions often took place there between Cittagahapati and the resident Bhikkhus （S.iv.281-97）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong eminent Elders who visited the place were \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Isidatta of   Avanti （who answered Citta’s questions regarding the reason for the   existence of various views in the world） （S.iv.283-8），  Mahaka （who，by his magic powers，produced rain and thunderstorms and   later showed a special miracle to Citta） （S.iv.288-91），  Kāmabhū （who discoursed to Citta on   various topics） （S.iv.291-5），and   Godatta （S.iv.295-7）.   The Elder Lakuntaka Bhaddiya also   lived there，in solitude，wrapt in meditation （Thag.v.466）.Behind Ambataka was Migapathaka，which was Citta’s tributary village （SA.iii.93） （v.l. Ambālavana）."]]
