[["V","Pāsānaka cetiya：A shrine near Rājagaha，where the disciples of Bivarī met and questioned the Buddha （SN．vs．1013）．The Buddha went there from Sāvatthi，knowing it to be the best place in which to meet them．Bāvarī’s disciples followed him thither．The cetiya was originally a shrine dedicated to some divinity （devatthāna） and built on a great rock，hence its name．Later，it was converted into a vihāra for the Buddha，being within easy reach of the town．Sakka built there a great hall （mandapa） for the Buddha （SNA．583，584）．This hall was evidently behind the cetiya （pitthipāsāne）．AA．i．184．"]]
