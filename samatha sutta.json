[["V","Samatha Sutta：A monk should practise introspection as to whether   he has won insight of the higher and insight into the dhamma，and also peace   of heart．Then he must put forth special effort to acquire what he has not   won，and he must obtain his requisites in such a way that unprofitable states   wane in him and profitable states increase．A．v．98ff．"]]
