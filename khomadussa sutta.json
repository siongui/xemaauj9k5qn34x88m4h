[["V","Khomadussa Sutta：Records the visit of the Buddha to Khomadussa．The brahmins were gathered on some business，and the Buddha walked into their meeting，thus angering them．It is said that he caused a shower of rain to fall （perhaps to give him an excuse for taking shelter）．When the brahmins protested against his intrusion，the Buddha told them that it was no ”council” where good men were not，and where the rules of debate were not observed； this sermon pleased them．S．i．184； SA．i．207．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e     \u003c/i\u003e"]]
