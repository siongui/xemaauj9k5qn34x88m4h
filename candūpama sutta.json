[["V","Candūpama Sutta：Monks who visit families must be like the moon，just as is Mahā Kassapa．They should be unobtrusive，retiring in demeanour．They should preserve their freedom and not be bound．Monks should teach the doctrine out of compassion for others，not in order to win their approval （S．ii．197f．; see also MA．i．14）．"]]
