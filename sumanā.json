be superior in life span，beauty，happiness，honour and power．There would still be a difference between them，even when，in later life，they both enter the Order，but the difference would cease to exist on

point of the sword，obtained the king’s permission to entertain the Buddha and his monks，it was the senāpati’s privilege to invite the Buddha to his house on the first day．When Sumanā came back from playing，she found her mother in tears，and when asked the reason，her mother replied，”If your father had been alive，ours would have been the privilege of entertaining the Buddha today．” Sumanā comforted her by saying that that honour should yet be theirs．She filled a golden bowl with richly flavoured milk rice，covering it with another bowl．She then wrapped both vessels all round with jasmine flowers and left the house with her slaves．On the way to the senāpati’s house she was stopped by his men，but she coaxed them to let her pass，and，as the Buddha approached，saying that she wished to offer him a jasmine garland，she put the two vessels into his alms bowl．She then made the resolve that in every subsequent birth she should be named Sumanā and that her body should be like a garland of jasmine．When the Buddha arrived in the senāpati’s house and was served first with soup，he covered his bowl saying that he had already been given his food．At the end of the meal the senāpati made enquiries，and，full of admiration for Sumanā’s courage，invited her to his house and made her his chief consort．Ever after that she was known as Sumanā，and，wherever she was born，a shower of jasmine flowers fell knee deep on the day of her birth．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Therīgāthā Commentary （ThigA．22f），Sumanā joined the Order in her old age．She was present when the Buddha

vihāra，taking such things as rugs and carpets，which she presented to the Order．The Buddha preached to her and to Pasenadi，and she became ananāgāmī．She then sought ordination，and，at the conclusion of
