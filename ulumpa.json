[["V","Ulumpa：A township of the Sākyans．The Buddha once stayed there and was visited by Pasenadi，king of Kosala，who felt remorse for the murder of his general Bandhula．The king went alone inside the Gandhakuti，laying aside the symbols of royalty which he left with his minister Dīgha-Kārāyana．When the king came out，he found that all his followers had gone，leaving behind only one horse and a serving-woman．On learning that Vidūdabha had been made king，Pasenadi left for Rājagaha，to seek the help of Ajātasattu，and died outside the city-gates．J．iv．151f； DhA．i．356．See also Medatalumpa．"]]
