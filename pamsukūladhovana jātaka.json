[["V","Pamsukūladhovana Jātaka：The Sumangala Vilāsinī （DA．i．130） mentions a Jātaka by this name，together with the Vessantara Jātaka，and says that the earth trembled at the preaching of these Jātakas．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFausboll’s edition contains no Jātaka of this name，nor have I been able to trace it elsewhere．It may have some connection with the Pamsukūladhovana pātihāriya，which formed one of the fifteen hundred miracles that assisted the conversion of Uruvela Kassapa．See Vin．i．29．"]]
