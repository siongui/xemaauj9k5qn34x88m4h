He lived in the heap of sand which was made by Aggidatta and his followers，who had made a vow to bring from somewhere a jar of sand and empty it at an agreed spot whenever a sinful thought occurred to them. WhenMoggallāna visited Aggidatta and asked him for a lodging，Aggidatta refused to give him one，but Moggallāna，in spite of his protests，occupied the sand-hill. Moggallāna overcame the power of the Nāga king by his iddhi-power，and when Aggidatta and his followers visited him the next morning，they found Ahicchatta standing with his hood over Moggallāna’s head as protection for him from the sun.
