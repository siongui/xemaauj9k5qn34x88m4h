[["V","Nālikīra：King of Dantapura in Kālinga．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce，a holy ascetic came with five hundred others and took up his abode in the royal park．Nālikira visited the ascetic and was displeased with the questions he was asked as to whether he ruled his people righteously．He therefore invited the ascetics to his palace，filled their bowls with filth，and had them beaten and attacked by dogs．The earth opened and swallowed the king．He was born in the Sunakha niraya，where he had to undergo various kinds of tortures．His kingdom was destroyed and became a waste （J．v．119，143，144f．； MA．ii．602ff．； Mtu．iii．361，368，369）．The story was evidently widely current in India．"]]
