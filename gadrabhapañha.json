Mahosadha，understanding the significance of the message，went to the palace，sending his father on before him．When Mahosadha entered he found his father seated，but，as had been prearranged，he obliged his father to get up and offer him his seat．On this there was a great uproar，all saying that he had slighted his father．But Mahosadha convinced the king that he was a more excellent man than his father，giving proof of this by producing before the king an ass which he had brought with him，and making the king acknowledge that a colt born of the ass through a Sindh mare would be far more valuable than the colt’s sire （J.vi.342f）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is also given as a separate Jātaka （No.111）．J.i.424."],["K","gadrabhapañha：ဂဒြဘပဉှ（တိ）\u003cbr\u003e  [ဂဒြဘ+ပဉှ]\u003cbr\u003e  မြည်း-မြဲ-ပြဿနာ။"]]
