[["V","Javasakuna Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once a woodpecker，and coming across a lion with a bone stuck in his throat he removed the bone，after having fixed a stick in the lion’s mouth to prevent him from biting off the head of his rescuer．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater，he saw the lion eating the carcase of a buffalo and asked for a boon．The lion refused，saying it was enough for him to have escaped death after putting his head into a lion’s jaws．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe lion is identified with Devadatta，and the story was related in reference to his ingratitude．J．iii．25-7； cp．Jātakamāla No．xxxiv．"]]
