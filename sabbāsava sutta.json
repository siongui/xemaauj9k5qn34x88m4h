[["V","Sabbāsava Sutta：The second sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya．It was   preached at Jetavana，and describes how the cankers （āsavā） can be destroyed．  Extirpation of the āsavas comes only to those who know and see things as they   really are．āsavas can be got rid of in many ways：by scrutiny，restraint，  use，endurance，avoidance，removal and culture．The sutta describes these   various ways．M．i．6ff．"]]
