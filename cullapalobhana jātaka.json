[["V","Cullapalobhana Jātaka：The Bodhisatta once left the Brahma-world and was born as the son of theBenares king，but would have nothing to do with women．When he grew up his father was filled with despair，and then a dancing-girl offered to seduce the prince．She sang outside his door till he was filled with desire．Eventually he came to know the joys of love，and filled with madness，ran amok through the streets，chasing people．The king banished both his son and his seducer，and they lived in a hut away down the Ganges．One day a hermit visited the hut and，seeing the woman，lost his power of flying through the air．When he saw the Bodhisatta he ran away and fell into the sea．The Bodhisatta，realising his plight，told him of the wiles of women and helped him to regain his lost power，while he himself sent the woman back to the haunts of men and became an ascetic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a backsliding brother．J.ii.328ff"]]
