[["V","Nalasākiyā：A branch of the Sākiyas．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Vidūdabha waged war on the Sākiyans，he gave orders that all those calling themselves by the name of Sākiya should be slain．His men went about asking for those who were called Sākiyans．Some of these therefore took blades of grass in their teeth and others reeds．When asked if they were Sakiyas，the former said ”not sāka ” （potherb） but ”grass，” （tina），and the latter ”not sāka ” （potherb） but ”reed” （nala）．Owing to this play on their name they escaped death．Thenceforth they were known respectively asTinasākiya and Nalasākiya （DhA．i．358f）．"]]
