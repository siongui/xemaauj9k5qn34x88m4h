and tried to bring about an abortion，but failed．Bimbisāra satisfied her longing．When Bimbisāra was imprisoned by Ajātasattu she waited upon him，taking him food till she was absolutely prevented from doing so．After his death she died of grief，and Pasenadi made war on Ajātasattu to avenge her death．J．ii．237； 403； iii．121f．"],["V","Kosala：A country inhabited by the Kosalā，to the north-west of Magadha and next to Kāsī． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is mentioned second in the list of sixteen Mahājanapadas （E．g．，A．i．213； iv．252，etc．）．In the Buddha’s time it was a powerful kingdom ruled over by Pasenadi，who was succeeded by his son Vidūdabha．By this time Kāsī was under the subjection of Kosala，for we find that when Bimbisāra，king of Magadha，married Kosaladevī，daughter of Mahākosala and sister of Pasenadi，a village in Kāsī was given as part of the dowry （J．ii．237； iv．342f）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVarious Jātakas indicate that the struggle between Kāsi and Kosala had been very prolonged （See，e．g．，J．ii．21f； iii．115f； 211f； v．316，425）．Sometimes the Kāsi king would attack Kosala，capture the king and rule over the country．At others the Kosala king would invade Kāsi and annex it to his own territory．Several Kosala kings who succeeded in doing this，are mentioned by name - e．g．，Dabbasena （J．iii．13），Dīghāvu （J．iii．211f），Vanka （J．iii．168） and Kamsa； the last being given the special title of ”Bāranāsiggāha，” （J．ii．403； v．112） probably in recognition of the fact that he completed the conquest of Kāsi．Other kings of Kosala who came in conflict with Benares in one way or another are mentioned -
