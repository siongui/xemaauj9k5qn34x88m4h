[["V","Paripunnaka Thera：He belonged to a Sākyan family of Kapilavatthu，and was so called because of the completeness of his gifts and fortune．His means allowed him to enjoy，at all times，food of one hundred essences．On hearing that the Buddha lived on very simple diet，he renounced the world，and entering the Order，became an arahant．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe had been a householder in the time of Dhammadassī Buddha and had offered various gifts at his shrine．Ninety four kappas ago he was king sixteen times under the name of Thūpasikhara （Thag．vs．91； ThagA．i．190f）．He is probably identical with Thambhāropaka of the Apadāna．Ap．i．171．"]]
