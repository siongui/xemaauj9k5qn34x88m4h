[["V","Bandhanāgāra Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once born in a poor family and supported his mother．Having provided him with a wife，much against his will，she died soon after．When his wife was with child，he wished to go away and became an ascetic，but his wife persuaded him to stay．On her second conception he ran away and，becoming an ascetic，rejoiced in his freedom from the bonds of wife and family．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related when some monks reported to the Buddha that a gang of thieves had been taken captive by \u003ci\u003ePasenadi\u003c/i\u003e and put in chains．No chains were stronger than those of passion，said the Buddha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJ．i．139ff．; cp．\u003ci\u003eBandhana Sutta\u003c/i\u003e （2）; the verses given in the Jātaka are also found there．"]]
