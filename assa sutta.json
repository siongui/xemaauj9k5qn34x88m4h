[["V","Assa Sutta：Once Assa，the ＂Jockey＂ （assāroha） of Rājagaha came to the Buddha to ask if it were true that a horse-trainer，if he exerted himself in the performance of his duties，would be born among the Sarañjita devas？ The Buddha tells him that such a view is a perverted one and that its result is rebirth either in purgatory or as an animal．Assa expresses his consternation and declares himself thenceforth a follower of the Buddha．S．iv．310．"]]
