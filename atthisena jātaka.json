[["V","Atthisena Jātaka：The story of Atthisena as given above．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome monks in ālavī were begging everywhere for materials and aid to build houses for themselves．People were annoyed by their solicitations and avoided them．When Mahā Kassapa came to ālavī people ran away from him thinking he too was one of the monks．On enquiry he learnt the reason and told it to the Buddha，who was then at the Aggālava-cetiya．The Buddha rebuked the monks，saying that formerly samanas and recluses，even though offered their choice by kings，never asked for alms，holding that begging from others was neither agreeable nor pleasant．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Manikantha Jātaka （J．ii．282ff） was also preached on the same occasion．"]]
