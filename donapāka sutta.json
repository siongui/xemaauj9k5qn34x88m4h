[["V","Donapāka Sutta：Once Pasenadi，uncomfortable and short of breath after a heavy meal，visited the Buddha．The Buddha admonished him on the evils of gluttony and taught the young Sudassana，who came with Pasenadi，a verse to be repeated whenever food was placed before the king．The king paid the young man one hundred kahāpanas daily for this service．Pasenadi profited by the lesson and became healthy．S.i.81； DhA.iii.264f gives a fuller version of this story．There Sudassana is described as the king’s nephew．This is also probably the incident mentioned at DhA.iv.15f； but the youth there is called Uttara."]]
