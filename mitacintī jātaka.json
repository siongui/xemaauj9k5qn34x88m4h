[["V","Mitacintī Jātaka：There were once three fishes   Bahucintī，Appacintī and Mitacintī - who，one day，left their haunts and came to where men dwelt．Mitacintī （the Bodhisatta） saw the danger and warned the others，but they would not listen and were caught in a net．Then Mitacintī splashed about and deceived the fishermen into thinking that the other two had escaped．They thereupon raised the net by one single corner and the other two escaped．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to two aged monks who spent the rainy season in the forest，wishing to go to the Buddha．But they constantly postponed their visit and it was not till three months after the end of the rains that they finally arrived at Jetavana．The two monks are identified with the thoughtless fish．J．i．426-8．"]]
