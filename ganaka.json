[["V","Ganaka：The one hundred and seventh sutta of the Majjhima Nikāya； preached to Ganaka-Moggallāna．Moggallāna says that the brahmanical training is a thoroughly graduated system （anupub-basikkhā anupubbakiriyā）．Can the Buddha say the same of his teaching? The Buddha says he can and proceeds to explain．It is true that not all the Buddha’s disciples attain to the goal，but the fault is theirs； the Buddha accepts no responsibility，he only indicates the way．M.iii.1ff."],["V","Ganaka：A brahmin teacher of Sāvatthi．He visited the Buddha at the Pubbārāma，and the Buddha preached to him the Ganaka-Moggallāna Sutta，after which，it is said，he became the Buddha’s follower （M.iii.1ff）．His name and his teaching seem to indicate that he was a mathematician."]]
