[["V","Mahāsīhanāda Sutta：Preached at the Mahāvana in Vesāli．Sāriputta tells the Buddha that Sunakkhatta，who had recently left the Order，went about saying that there was nothing marvellous about the Buddha’s knowledge and insight and that his teachings did not lead to the end of Ill．The Buddha says that Sunakkhatta is a man of wrath and folly and incapable of appreciating the good either of the Tathāgata or of his teachings．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe then issues his challenge to the effect that no one can deny to the Tathāgata the possession of ten powers，（balā） -  which are enumerated -  and the four confidences （vesārajjā）．The Tathāgata can attend any of the eight assemblies without fear； he knows the various classifications of beings，the birth of beings，the way to Nibbāna； he can read the minds of men and the five destinies which await different beings．He has lived the fourfold higher life being foremost in his practice of asceticism，in loathliness，in scrupulosity，in solitude．No one has surpassed him in the practice of these things．He has discovered，by experimentation，the futility of the claims of those who maintain that purity comes by way of food，or offering，or ritual．Though eighty years old and his body broken down，yet his powers of mind are at their prime； even if he must be carried on a litter，yet will his mind retain its powers （M．i．68 83）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNāgasamāla，who is by，asks the Buddha for a title for the discourse，and the Buddha gives it the name of Lomahamsapariyāya．cp．Lomahamsa Jātaka．"]]
