household，became an ascetic．On hearing that Kassapa had become Buddha，he visited him but expressed great disappointment on discovering that he ate flesh food （āmagandha）．The Buddha taught him that āmagandha was not really flesh but the kilesas which corrupt the heart，and he preached to him the āmagandha Sutta．Tissa immediately entered the Order and became an aggasāvaka （Bu．xxv．39；

went home and was persuaded by his relations to return to the lay life．Later，Metteyya，passing through the village with the Buddha，during a journey，visited Tissa and brought him once more to the

robe．She had the cloth pounded and spun into fine yarn and made of it a soft robe-cloth．At first Tissa would not accept it but was prevailed upon to do so and had it made into a soft robe by skilled robe-makers．He died on the night it was finished and，as a result of his fancy for it，was reborn as a louse in the robe．After his death，the monks wished to divide the robe but the louse started shouting．The Buddha，hearing this by his power of divine audience，asked the monks to lay the robe aside for seven days．At the end of that period，the louse was reborn in the Tusita world．DhA．iii．341ff．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e11．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A monk．When the Buddha declared that in four months he would pass away，many monks were greatly excited，collecting in groups，not knowing what to do．But Tissa remained aloof，determined to win arahantship before the Buddha’s death．The others，misunderstanding him，reported to the Buddha that Tissa had no love for him，but the Buddha，having questioned him，praised his earnestness．DhA．iii．267f．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e12．Tissa Thera．\u003c/i\u003e-An arahant．He belonged to a brahmin family of Rājagaha and，having attained great proficiency in the Vedas，became a teacher of five hundred young men．When the Buddha visited Rājagaha，Tissa was so struck by his majesty that he joined the Order，later winning arahantship．The Theragāthā contains verses uttered by him regarding certain monks who were jealous of his great renown．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Piyadassī Buddha，Tissa was an ascetic．Seeing the Buddha in samādhi in a forest-grove，he built over him an arbour of silo flowers and for seven days paid him homage．（Thag．vv．153-4； ThagA．i．272f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is evidently identical with Sālamandapiya of the Apadāna （ii．431f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e13．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A rājā of Roruva．He was an ”unseen” ally of Bimbisāra and，as such，sent him various gifts．The king sent him in return a painted panel on which was depicted the life of the Buddha and a gold plate specially inscribed with the Paticcasamuppāda．On seeing these，Tissa’s mind was filled with agitation and，giving up his title，he came to Rājagaha as a monk and lived in theSappasondika cave，from there visiting the Buddha，and soon afterwards becoming an arahant．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a chariot-maker and gave the Buddha a stool made of sandalwood．Fifty-seven kappas ago he was four times king under the name of Santa （Bhavanimmita） （Thag．97； ThagA．i．199f）．He is probably identical with Phalakadāyaka of the Apadāna （i．174）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e14．Tissa Thera．\u003c/i\u003e-An arahant．Son of the Buddha’s paternal aunt，Amitā．He entered the Order and dwelt in a woodland settlement，but he was proud of his rank and irritable and captious in his conduct．He once came to the Buddha in tears because his colleagues had teased him on account of his talkativeness （S．ii．282； MA．i．289）．On another occasion，the Buddha，with his celestial eye，saw Tissa sleeping with open mouth during the siesta and，sending a ray of glory，woke him．Tissa’s heart was filled with anguish and when he confessed to his colleagues his mental laziness and distaste for religion，they brought him to the Buddha．The Buddha preached to him the Tissa Sutta，at the end of which he became an arahant （Thag．v．39； but see v．1162； S．iii．106f； ThagA．i．105）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Tissa Buddha he swept the leaves from the foot of the Bodhi-tree．He is evidently identical with Bodhisammajjaka of the Apadāna （Ap．ii．457f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dhammapada Commentary （i．31ff） calls him Thullatissa．He entered the Order when old and became fat through idleness．He spent most of his time in the Waiting-hall draped in rich robes．Monks，taking him for a Mahā Thera，begged the privilege of performing various services for him，such as massaging his feet．But when they discovered his attainments，they reviled him and he sought the Buddha．The Buddha，however，asked him to obtain their pardon for having failed to show them due honour，and when he refused，related to him the story of Nārada and Devala．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e15．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A novice．He was a gatekeeper’s son and，coming with some carpenters to Sāvatthi，joined the Order．He was constantly finding fault with the food and other offerings，even those given by Anāthapindika，and he boasted of the riches enjoyed by his kinsfolk．His colleagues made enquiries and，discovering the truth about his antecedents，reported him to the Buddha who preached the Katāhaka Jātaka （q．v．） to show his similar tendencies in the past （DhA．iii．367）．Tissa was identified with Katāhaka of the Jātaka．J．i．455．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e16．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A monk．He was called Kosambivāsī Tissa．He spent the rainy season at Kosambī and，on his departure，his supporter gave him three robes and other offerings； he，however，refused them saying that he had no novice to look after them．The layman immediately gave his son，then seven years old，to be his novice．The boy attained arahantship in the Tonsure-hall．While on his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha，Tissa accidentally blinded the novice by hitting his eye with a fan at dawn．The Elder was filled with remorse and，falling at the boy’s feet，asked his pardon．But the answer was that there was no fault to pardon，the accident was due to samsāra．When the matter was reported to the Buddha he said that such was the nature of arahants．They felt no resentment．At the end of the discourse，Tissa became an arahant （DhA．ii．182ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e17．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A monk，called Asubhakammika-Tissa．He is mentioned in the Commentaries （VibhA．270） as an example of a good friend，devoted to the contemplation of asubha，association with whom helps one to get rid of lust．His teacher was Mahātissa of Kotapabbata-vihāra．MT．553．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e18．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A master of writing （lekhācariya）．Even after his death he was known by reason of his

afterwards，he heard a slave-girl singing； her song told of how men are subject to death just as the lotus opens to the sun．Tissa thereupon developed insight and became an arahant．SNA．ii．397．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e21．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-Uncle of Pandukābhaya．He administered the kingdom when his elder brother，Abhaya，gave up the government．He was killed

to teach him the reason，gave him the throne for a week，saying that at the end of the week he would be put to death．Tissa then realised that monks，who had the constant consciousness of death，could not be merry．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe later became a monk under Yonaka Mahādhammarakkhita and lived in the Asokārāma，where he prevented the murder of the theras by the minister sent by Asoka to make the monks hold the uposatha together．He became an arahant and，on account of his love of solitude，came to be known as Ekavihāriya．Thag．vv．537-46； ThagA．i．503f； Mhv．v．33，60，154ff，241；

and was banished．He sent the queen a letter through an attendant to an arahant who was in the habit of visiting the palace．This letter fell into the hands of the king who suspected the arahant himself，owing to a similarity in his writing to that of the intriguer．The king ordered the arahant to be killed and cast into the sea．The devas，being offended，caused the sea to overflow the land．The total destruction of the country was only averted by the king sending his daughter Devī （afterwards Vihāramahadevī），to sea in a golden boat．The Rasavāhini，however，says he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling oil； see Telakatāhagāthā．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTissa’s father was Mutasiva and his grandfather Uttiya．MT．431．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e25．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A minister

invitation to the meal．（For details see Mhv．xxiv．22ff； AA．i．365）．It was probably the mother of this Tissa who，we are told （Vsm．，p．63），used a cloth worth one hundred to wipe away the impurities of her son’s birth，which cloth she afterwards threw out on to the Tālaveli road hoping that it might prove useful to a pāmsukūlika monk．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e26．Tissa．\u003c/i\u003e-A
