[["V","Sakuna Jātaka：The，Bodhisatta was once a bird，leader of a large flock．He lived in a tree，and noticing one day that two of the boughs were grinding one against the other and producing smoke，he warned his flock of the risk of fire and left for elsewhere．The wiser birds followed him，but some remained behind and were burnt to death．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related to a monk whose cell was burnt down．He told the villagers of this，and they continually promised to build him a new one，but failed to do so．As a result the monk lived in discomfort and his meditations were fruitless．When he reported this，the Buddha blamed him for not going elsewhere．J．i．215f．"]]
