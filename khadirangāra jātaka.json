[["V","Khadirangāra Jātaka：Once the Bodhisatta was Treasurer of Benares，and a Pacceka Buddha，rising from a seven days’ samāpatti，came to him at meal time．The Bodhisatta sent him some food，but Māra created a pit of glowing khadira-embers between the Pacceka Buddha and the Treasurer’s house．When the Treasurer heard of this，he took the bowl of food himself and stepped into the pit，ready to die rather than to have his alms-giving thwarted．A lotus sprang up to receive his foot，the pit vanished，and Māra，discomfited，vanished．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related to Anāthapindika．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA devatā，who lived in the upper storey of his palace，had to come with her children down to the ground floor whenever the Buddha visited Anāthapindika．She tried to check the merchant’s munificence by talking to his manager and his eldest son，but all in vain．At last，when as a result of his extreme piety Anāthapindika’s wealth was exhausted，the devatā ventured to approach him and warn him of his impending ruin if he did not take heed．He ordered her out of the house，and she had，perforce，to obey．In despair she sought the aid of Sakka，who suggested that she should recover for the merchant all his debts，and reveal to him his hidden treasure which had been lost sight of．She did so，but Anāthapindika，before consenting to pardon her，took her to the Buddha，who then related this Jātaka．The Velāmaka Sutta was also preached on this occasion （J．i．226-34； see also theVisayha Jātaka）．For a continuation of the story see the Siri Jātaka．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Dhammapada Commentary （DhA．i．447） the Khadirangāra Jākata was preached in reference to the two friends Sirigutta and Gharadinna．It is said （AA．i．57） that at the preaching of the Jātaka eighty-four thousand beings realised the Truth．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e     \u003c/i\u003e"]]
