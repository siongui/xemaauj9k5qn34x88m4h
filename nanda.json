Buddha． He was only a few days younger than the Buddha，and when the Buddha’s mother died，Pajapati gave her own child to nurses and suckled the Buddha herself （AA．i．186）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the third day of the Buddha’s visit to Kapilavatthu，after the Enlightenment，the Buddha went to Nanda’s house，where festivities were in progress in honour of Nanda’s coronation and marriage to Janapadakalyānī Nandā．The Buddha wished Nanda good fortune and handed him his bowl to be taken to the vihāra．Nanda，thereupon，accompanied the Buddha out of the palace．Janapadakalyānī，seeing him go，asked him to return quickly．Once inside the vihāra，however，the Buddha asked Nanda to become a monk，and he，unable to refuse the request，agreed with reluctance．But as the days passed he was tormented with thoughts of his beloved，and became very downcast and despondent，and his health suffered．The Buddha suggested that they should visit the Himālaya．On the way there，he showed Nanda the charred remains of a female monkey and asked him whether Janapadakalyānī were more beautiful than that．The answer was in the affirmative．The Buddha then took him toTāvatimsa where Sakka，with his most beautiful nymphs，waited on them．In answer to a question by the Buddha，Nanda admitted that these nymphs were far more attractive than Janapadakalyānī，and the Buddha promised him one as wife if he would live the monastic life．Nanda was all eagerness and readily agreed．On their return to Jetavana the Buddha related this story to the eighty chief disciples，and when they questioned Nanda，he felt greatly ashamed of his lustfulness．Summoning all his courage，he strove hard and，in no long time，attained arahantship．He thereupon came to the Buddha and absolved him from his promise．（Thag．157f．； J．i．91； ii．92ff．； Ud．iii．2； DhA．i．96 105； UdA．168ff．； SNA．273f．） \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the Buddha was told of Nanda’s arahantship by a devata，he related theSangāmāvacara Jātaka to show how，in the past，too，Nanda had been quick to follow advice．He also related the story of Kappata and his donkey to show that it was not the first time that Nanda had been won to obedience by the lure of the female sex．The male donkey in the story was Nanda and the female donkey Janapadakalyānī．（DhA．i．103f．）\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNanda is identified with the sub king （uparājā） in theKurudhamma Jātaka．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater，on seeing how eminently Nanda was trained in self control，the Buddha declared him chief among his disciples in that respect （indriyesu guttadvārānam）．Nanda had aspired to this eminence in the time of Padumuttara Buddha．In the time of Atthadassi Buddha he was a tortoise in the river Vinatā，and，seeing the Buddha on the bank waiting to cross，he took him over to the other side on his back．（A．i．25； AA．i．174f．； ThagA．i．276ff．） \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is said to have been called Nanda because his birth brought joy to his kinsmen．The Apadāna （i．57） says he was of golden hue，as reward for a gift of a costly robe given by him to Padumuttara．One hundred thousand kappas ago he became king four times under the name of Cela．Sixty thousand kappas ago he was again king in four births，under the name of Upacela．Later，five thousand kappas ago，he was four times cakkavatti，and his name then，too，was Cela．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNanda was very beautiful，and was only four inches shorter than the Buddha．He once wore a robe made according to the dimensions of the Buddha’s robe．Discovering this，the Buddha chided him for his presumption （Vin．iv．173）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps this is another version of the story found at S．ii．281．There，Nanda is said to have donned a robe which was pressed on both sides，painted his face，and gone to see the Buddha，carrying a bright bowl．The Buddha chided him，and Nanda thereupon became a forest dweller and a rag-robe-man．Buddhaghosa （SA．ii．174） says that Nanda dressed himself up in order to evoke some comment from the Buddha - either approval，so that he might dress thus for the remainder of his life，or censure，in which case he would put on rag robes and dwell in the forest．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Anguttara Nikaya （A．iv．166f） contains a discourse in which the Buddha discusses Nanda’s claim to have achieved self control in all things．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably to be identified with Taraniya Thera of the Apadāna．（ii．428； cp．ThagA．i．277．）\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Nanda\u003c/i\u003eCalled

the monks，using as simile a log of wood   how，in certain circumstances，it finds its way direct to the sea   and how，similarly，a monk may reach Nibbāna．Nanda asked permission to join the Order．But the Buddha insisted that he should first return the cattle，for which he was responsible，to their owners．Nanda did so，and was then ordained，becoming an arahant soon after．S．iv．181．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e4．Nanda Thera\u003c/i\u003eAn arahant．In the past he was once a hunter，and，while wandering in the forest，he saw a Pacceka Buddha named Anuruddha．He built for the Buddha a hut thatched with lotus flowers，and，having listened to the Buddha’s preaching，became a monk．Soon after he fell ill，died，and was born in Tusita．He possessed the power of travelling through the air and of walking over the sea．In this birth he visited the Buddha and questioned him regarding the ”further shore．” At the end of the conversation he became an arahant．Ap．ii．350f．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably identical with No．3 above．See DA．i．122，where Nanda Gopalaka’s questions are given； these seem to correspond with Nanda Thera’s questions

the Buddha paid him a visit，lasting seven days，and Nanda entertained him and his monks with the choicest foods．On the seventh day the Buddha preached to him and he became a sotapanna．He accompanied

thousand years，Padumuttara visited him in the forest，and，later，ten thousand of his followers joined the Buddha．Nanda provided them all with seats made of heavenly flowers，the Buddha’s being one league in height．Nanda stood by the Buddha for seven days，holding an umbrella made of flowers．Nanda and the rest of his disciples joined the Order，and all except Nanda became arahants，he being bore in the Brahma world after death．Later，for five hundred births he was a forest dweller living alone on Mount Nisabha in Himavā．He was king of the devas for eighty births．（Ap．i．67； ThagA．i．17f．； AA．i．124f．） He
