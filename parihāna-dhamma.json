[["N","parihāna-dhamma：'liable to decline'．＂Now，someone reaches the attainments （absorptions：\u003ci\u003ejhāna\u003c/i\u003e，q．v．） of the fine-material or immaterial sphere （s．\u003ci\u003eavacara\u003c/i\u003e）．But he does not reach them according to his wish，and not without trouble and exertion； and not according to his wish with regard to place，object and duration，does he enter them，or rise therefrom．Therefore it is well possible that such a monk，through negligence，may lose these attainments．Such a person is said to be liable to decline＂ （Pug．5）．"]]
