[["V","Panduputta：An ājīvaka．He came of a wagon building stock of bygone days．In the Anangana Sutta （M．i．31f），Moggallāna tells Sāriputta that，one day，when begging alms in Rājagaha，he came to the house of Samīti，the wagon builder who was shaping a felloe．Standing by was Panduputta，watching him and wishing that he should shape it without blemish．When Samīti did so，Panduputta expressed his joy，saying that Samīti had read his thoughts．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa says （MA．i．124） that Panduputta was so called because he was the son of Pandu．"]]
