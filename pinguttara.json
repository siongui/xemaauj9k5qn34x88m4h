[["V","Pinguttara：A lad of Mithilā who studied in Takkasilā and was given in marriage his teacher’s beautiful daughter．But he was unlucky and intensely disliked his wife，avoiding her whenever possible．On the way to Mithilā，when his wife climbed up a fig tree in order to assuage her hunger，he put thorns round the tree and left her there．King Videha of Mithilā rescued her and married her，naming her Udumbarā．Some time later she saw Pinguttara mending the road，and smiled at her own good fortune．The king was ready to kill her out of jealousy，but Mahosadha saved her life．J．vi．347f．"]]
