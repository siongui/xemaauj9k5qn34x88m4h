[["V","Migajālena Sutta：Migajāla visits the Buddha and asks what is meant by an ekavihārī （lone dweller） and what by a sadutiyavihārī （living with a mate）．The Buddha answers that he who is enamored of objects of sense is a sadutiyavihāri，while the lone dweller is he who has cast off craving．S．iv．35f．"]]
