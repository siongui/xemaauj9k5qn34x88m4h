[["V","Gonaraviya Thera：A monk of Ceylon，probably a colleague of Mahāsīva．It is said that Mahāsīva was explaining to him the Mahā Saccaka Sutta，and that when he came to the passage where the Buddha charges Saccaka with not understanding the training of the body，much less that of the mind，Gonaraviya laid aside his fan and walked away，saying that the Buddha could not have said such a thing； but Mahāsīva persuaded him that it was so．v.l．Moranāla．MA.i.463."]]
