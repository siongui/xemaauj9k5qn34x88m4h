[["V","Gopālamātā：Queen consort of Udena．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe belonged to a poor merchant’s family in Telappanāli and had long and beautiful hair，the envy of her friends．One day，Mahā Kaccāna and seven others visited the village，and she sold her hair for eight kahāpanas，that she might provide the visitors with a meal．It is said that she recovered her hair immediately on seeing Mahā Kaccāna．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the Elder reached Ujjenī that very day，by air，he related the incident to King Udena and the king，having sent messengers to fetch Gopālamātā，made her his chief consort．She gave birth to a son，whom she called Gopāla，after her own father，and thenceforth she herself was called Gopālamātā．AA.i.118； Mil.291."]]
