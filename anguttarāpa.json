[["V","Anguttarāpa：A country north of the river Mahī，evidently a part of Anga on the other side of that river （Angā eva so janapado； Gangāya [Mahāmahīgangāya] pana yā uttarena āpo，tāsam avidūrattā Uttarāpati vuccati） （SnA.ii.437）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was here，in the village āpana，that the Buddha was staying when theJatila Keniya came to see him； here also was preached the Sela Sutta （Sn.102f）. FromBhaddiya （in Anga），（DhA.i.384） the Buddha went to Anguttārapa and thence to āpana （Vin.i.243-5； DhA.iii.363）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe country was probably rich because we find as many as 1，250 monks accompanying the Buddha on his tour （Sn.102f）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther suttas preached here are the Potaliya （M.i.359），and the Latukikopama （M.i.447）. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eApana seems to have been the chief township，because it is always mentioned in connection with Anguttarāpa."]]
