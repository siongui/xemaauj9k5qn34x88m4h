[["V","Sattabhariyā Sutta：Once，when the Buddha visited Anāthapindika’s house，he heard a great noise，and when he asked the reason for this，he was told that it was due to Anāthapindika’s daughter in law，Sujātā，who had come from a wealthy family and would not listen to anyone’s advice．The Buddha sent for her and told her of seven kinds of wives in the world   the slayer，the robber，the mistress，the mother，the sister，the companion，the handmaid   and described their qualities．Sujātā，much impressed，said that henceforth she would be a handmaid （A．iv．91f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Commentary says （AA．ii．724） that she was established in the Refuges； but see Sujātā．"]]
