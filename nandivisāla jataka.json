[["V","Nandivisāla Jataka：Once the Bodhisatta was born as a bull in Gandhāra and was named Nandivisāla．When quite young，he was given to a Brahmin，who fed him on delicacies and looked after him．When Nandi grew up，in order to show his gratitude to the Brahmin，he suggested that he should draw one hundred carts for a wager．The Brahmin boasted to his friends and had a wager with them．On the appointed day he loaded one hundred carts，lashed them together，and having tied Nandivisala to the first，took his seat on the pole and，flourishing his goad，shouted，”Now，you rascal，pull．” The bull，very offended，would not stir，and the Brahmin lost his money．As he lay groaning in bed，Nandivisala went to him and said that he should not have abused him．He then asked him to wager two thousand，and said that this time he would win．This the Brahmin did，and the next day，having tied one hundred carts together，he yoked Nandivisala to the frat and stroked his back saying，”Now then，my fine fellow，pull．” With one heave，Nandivisala pulled the carts，and the last stood where the first had been．Nandivisala’s master received many presents in addition to the wager．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to the taunts uttered by the Chabbaggiyas against the virtuous monks．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnanda was the brahmin of the story （J．i．191ff．； the story is also given at Vin．iv．5）．It was also related in connection with the Yamakapātihāriya．DhA．iii．213．"]]
