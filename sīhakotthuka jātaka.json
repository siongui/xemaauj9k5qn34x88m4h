[["V","Sīhakotthuka Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was，once a lion and had a cub by a she jackal．The cub was like his sire in appearance，but like his clam invoice．One day，after rain，when the lions were gambolling and roaring together，the cub thought to roar too，and yelped like a jackal．Thereupon all the lions at once fell silent．When the Bodhisatta was told of this by another cub he advised the jackal cub to keep quiet．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to Kokālika’s attempt to preach，Kokālika is identified with the jackal voiced cub and Rāhula with his brother．J．ii．108f．"]]
