[["V","Ājīvaka Sutta：A conversation between Ananda and a householder，a follower of the ājīvakas. The householder questions Ananda as to whose doctrine is well taught，who are the rightly conducted and who are the welfarers in the world. Ananda tells him the characteristics which are helpful in arriving at a decision on these questions，without praising one’s own creed or decrying another’s. The man expresses great satisfaction. A.i.217ff."]]
