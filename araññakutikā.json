[["V","Araññakutikā：Mention is made of several forest hermitages in the Buddha’s time．There was one，for instance，near Rājagaha，where Mahā Moggallāna （J．iii．33） used to spend his time and also Mahā Kassapa （J．iii．71）．Evidently other monks of the Order dwelt there from time to time，e．g．the novice Aciravata （M．iii．128）．There was one hermitage near Dīghambalika （DhA．ii．235） and another near Himavā （DhA．ii．31，129），where the Buddha sometimes went．"]]
