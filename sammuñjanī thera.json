[["V","Sammuñjanī Thera：So called because he was always sweeping．One day he saw Revata in his cell and thought him an idler．Revata read his thoughts，and，wishing to admonish him，asked him to return after a bath．When Sammuñjanī did so，Revata preached to him on the duties of a monk．Sammuñjanī became an arahant，and all the rooms remained unswept．The monks，reported this to the Buddha，who，however，declared him free from blame，since there was no need for him to continue sweeping．DhA．iii．168 f．"]]
