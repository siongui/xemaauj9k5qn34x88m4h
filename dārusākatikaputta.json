[["V","Dārusākatikaputta：The story of the son of a career．His father was a heretic，but he，while playing with a Buddhist lad，had learnt to say ”Praise be to the Buddha.” One day he went with his father on a journey，and as his father got locked into the city at sunset，he had to spend the night all alone under the cart outside the walls of Rājagaha．During the night，two Yakkhas tried to eat him，but in his dream he whispered ”Praise be to the Buddha” and was saved．The king，hearing the story，repeated it to the Buddha．DhA.iii.455ff."]]
