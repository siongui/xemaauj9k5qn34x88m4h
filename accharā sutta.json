[["V","Accharā Sutta：Connected with a monk，who，through over-exertion，died as he leaned against the terrace-post. His life-work unfinished，he is born in Tāvatimsa leaning against a door-post. Accosted by the nymphs with song and music，he thinks he is yet a monk till they bring a cheval-glass and reveal to him his figure. In disappointment he seeks the Master，who preaches to him. S.i.33； SA.i.67f."]]
