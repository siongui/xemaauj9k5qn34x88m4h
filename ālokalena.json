[["V","Ālokalena：A cave in the cleft of a mighty primeval landslide，not far from the modern Matale in Ceylon. According to tradition it was here that the Buddhist scriptures were first reduced to writing in Ceylon under the patronage of a chieftain of King Vattagāmani. The Burmese believe that Buddhaghosa’s Atthakathās were also written in this spot （Mhv.xxiii.100f. See PLC.43f）. In the eighteenth century King Vijayarājasīha built images of the Buddha in the rock cave. Cv.xcviii.65."]]
