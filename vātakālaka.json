[["V","Vātakālaka：An executioner of Rājagaha who worked for fifty years and then retired because of old age．As he had no time for luxuries during his years of work，on the day of his retirement he asked his wife to cook milk rice and went to bathe．On his way home，clad in clean garments，his body perfumed，he met Sāriputta，invited him to his house，and gave him various delicacies．At the end of the meal he accompanied the Elder for some distance，and，on his return，was gored to death by a cow with calf．After death he was reborn in Tāvatimsa．AA．i．368．\t"]]
