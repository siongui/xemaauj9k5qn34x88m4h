[["V","Ānañjasappāya Sutta：Preached to the monks，with ānanda at their head，by the Buddha at Kammassadhamma in the Kuru country. It deals with real Permanence （ānañjasappāya） and with the various ways of meditating on impassibility and the attainments and true release. True deathlessness is only the heart’s deliverance （anupādā cittassa vimokkho），and there are several stages of the paths that lead to it （M.ii.261ff）. Buddhaghosa （MA.ii.851） says that this sutta described the arahantship of the Sukkhavipassakā. Arahantship is mentioned in nine different connections in the sutta，which is therefore praised as being well taught （sukathitam）."],["V","ānañjasappāya Sutta：See ānañjasappāya Sutta."]]
