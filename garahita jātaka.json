[["V","Garahita Jātaka：Once the Bodhisatta was a monkey in the Himalayas and，having been captured by a forester，was given to the king．The king grew fond of him，and the monkey learnt the ways of men．The king set him free，and when his fellows saw him they insisted on hearing from him how men lived．He told them of men’s greed for possessions，and how in each house there were two masters，one of them beardless，with long breasts and plaited hair．The monkeys，hearing of this folly，stopped their ears and went elsewhere，saying they could not bear to live in a place where they had heard such unseemly things! That place came thereafter to be called the Garahitapitthi-pāsāna.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a discontented monk．J.ii.184."]]
