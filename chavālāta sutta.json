[["V","Chavālāta Sutta：Some people are bent neither on their own profit nor on that of others，some only on another’s profit，some only on their own，and yet others on the profit of both themselves and others．He who belongs to the first class is like a firebrand from a funeral pyre，blazing at both ends，smeared with dung in the middle，useless for any purpose．A.ii.95."]]
