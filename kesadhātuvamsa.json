[["V","Kesadhātuvamsa：A book containing the history of the Buddha’s Hair Relic．The Relic was brought to Ceylon from India by Silākāla in the reign of Moggallāna I．The king placed it in a crystal casket in a beautiful building with a picture of Dīpankara’s city （?） and established a festival in its honour．Silākāla was appointed custodian of the Relic （Cv．xxxix．49ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kesadhātuvamsa is not now available．It was evidently easily obtainable at the time of the writing of the first part of the Cūlavamsa （See，e．g．，Cv．xxxix．56）．It seems to have been quite distinct from the Chakesadhātuvamsa （q．v．）．"]]
