[["V","Hatthapadūpamā Sutta：Where there is a hand，there are seen taking   up and putting down．Similarly，with a foot are coming and going； with a limb，  bending and stretching； with a belly，hunger and thirst．Likewise，where there   is eye，arises eye contact，and consequent personal weal and woe，etc． S.iv.171f."]]
