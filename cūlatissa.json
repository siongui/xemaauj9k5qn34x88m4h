[["V","Cūlatissa：A minister of Dutthagāmanī．Once when Kandula was lost，he was sent in search and found him looking after the monks of Mahānijjhara．Tissa gave the monks a drink of kāra-fruit and sugar，and took the animal back to the king．Later，Tissa was born in Ambavitthi and entered the Order．Afterwards，while on a voyage to the Bodhi-tree in Gayā，his ship ran short of water．Tissa let down his bowl into the sea．The water became fresh and sweet，and he shared it with the others．After death he was born in the deva world．Ras.ii.29f."]]
