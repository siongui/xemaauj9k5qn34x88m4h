twenty-fourth Buddha，the third of the present neon （the Bhaddakappa） and one of the seven Buddhas mentioned in the Canon （D．ii．7）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  He was born in Benares，in the Deer Park at Isipatana， \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    of brahmin parents，Brahmadatta and Dhanavatī，belonging to the Kassapagotta． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    For two thousand years he lived in the household，in three different palaces，Hamsa，Yasa and Sirinanda．（The BuA．217 calls the first two palaces Hamsavā and Yasavā）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    He had as chief wife Sunandā，by whom he begot a son，Vijitasena． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    Kassapa left the world，traveling in his palace （pāsāda），and practiced austerities for only seven days． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    Just before his Enlightenment his wife gave him a meal of milk-rice，and a yavapāla named Soma gave him grass for his seat． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    His bodhi was a banyan-tree，and  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    he preached his first sermon at Isipatana to a crore of monks who had renounced the world in his company． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    He performed the Twin-Miracle at the foot of an asana-tree outside Sundaranagara． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    He held only one assembly of his disciples； among his most famous conversions was that of a yakkha，Naradeva （q．v．）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    His chief disciples were Tissa and Bhāradvāja among monks，and Anulā and Uruvelā among nuns，his constant attendant being Sabbamitta． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    Among his patrons，the most eminent were Sumangala and Ghattīkāra，Vijitasenā and Bhaddā． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    His body was twenty cubits high，and， \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    after having lived for twenty thousand years，he died in the Setavya pleasance at Setavyā in Kāsī． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e    Over his relics was raised a thūpa one league in height，each brick of which was worth one crore． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  It is said （MA．i．336ff ） that there was a great difference of opinion as to what should be the size of the thūpa and of what material it should be constructed； when these points were finally settled and the work of building had started，the citizens found they had not enough money to complete it．Then an anāgāmī devotee，named Sorata，went all over Jambudīpa，enlisting the help of the people for the building of the thūpa．He sent the money as he received it，and on hearing that the work was completed，he set out to go and worship the thūpa； but he was seized by robbers and killed in the forest，which later came to be known as the Andhavana．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUpavāna，in a previous birth，became the guardian deity of the cetiya，hence his great majesty in his last life （DA．ii．580； for another story of the building of the shrine see DhA．iii．29）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong the thirty-seven goddesses noticed by Guttila，when he visited heaven，was one who had offered a scented five-spray at the cetiya （J．ii．256）．So did Alāta offer āneja-flowers and obtain a happy rebirth （J．vi．227）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cause of Mahā-Kaccāna’s golden complexion was his gift of a golden brick to the building of Kassapa’s shrine （AA．i．116）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the same cetiya，Anuruddha，who was then a householder in Benares，offered butter and molasses in bowls of brass，which were placed without any interval around the cetiya （AA．i．105）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmong those who attained arahantship under Kassapa is mentioned Gavesī，who，with his five hundred followers，strove always to excel themselves until they attained their goal （A．iii．214ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMahākappina，then a clansman，built，for Kassapa’s monks，a parivena with one thousand cells （AA．i．175）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBakkula’s admirable health and great longevity were due to the fact that he had given the first fruits of his harvest to Kassapa’s monks （MA．iii．932）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the time of Kassapa Buddha，the Bodhisatta was a brahmin youth named Jotipāla who，afterwards，coming under the influence of Ghatīkāra，became a monk．（Bu．xxv．； BuA．217ff； D．ii．7； J．i．43，94； D．iii．196； Mtu．i．303ff，319）．This Ghatīkāra was later born in the Brahma-world and visited Gotama，after his Enlightenment．Gotama then reminded him of this past friendship，which Ghatīkāra seemed too modest to mention （S．i．34f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Majjhima Nikāya （M．ii．45f ） gives details of the earnestness with which Ghatīkāra worked for Jotipāla’s conversion when Kassapa was living at Vehalinga．The same sutta bears evidence of the great regard Kassapa had for Ghatīkāra．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe king of Benares at the time of Kassapa was Kikī，and the four gateways of Kassapa’s cetiya were built，one by Kikī，one by his son Pathavindhara，one by his ministers led by his general，and the last by his subjects with the treasurer at their head （SnA．i．194）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is said that the Buddha’s chief disciple，Tissa，was born on the same day as Kassapa and that they were friends from birth．Tissa left the world earlier and became an ascetic．When he visited the Buddha after his Enlightenment，he was greatly grieved to learn that the Buddha ate meat （āmagandha），and the Buddha preached to him the āmagandha Sutta，by which he was converted （SnA．i．280ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Ceylon Chronicles （Mhv．xv．128ff； Sp．i．87； Dpv．xv．55ff； Mbv．129） mention a visit paid by Kassapa to Ceylon in order to stop a war between King Jayanta and his younger brother．The island was then known as Mandadīpa，with Visāla as capital．The Buddha came with twenty thousand disciples and stood on Subhakūta，and the armies seeing him stopped the fight．In gratitude，Jayanta presented to the Buddha the Mahāsāgara garden，in which was afterwards planted a branch of the Bodhi-tree brought over by Sudhammā，in accordance with the Buddha’s wish．The Buddha preached at the Asokamālaka，the Sudassanamālaka and the Somanassamālaka，and gave his rain-cloak as a relic to the new converts，for whose spiritual guidance he left behind his disciples Sabbananda and Sudhammā and their followers．In Kassapa’s time Mt．Vepulla at Rājagaha was known as Supassa and its inhabitants as the Suppiyas （S．ii．192）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut many other places had the same names in the time of Kassapa as they had in the present age - e．g．，Videha （J．vi．122），Sāvatthi （J．vi．123），Kimbila （J．vi．121） and Bārānasī．（J．vi．120）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the āmagandha Sutta mentioned above，various other teachings are mentioned as having been first promulgated by Kassapa and handed on down to the time of Gotama and re-taught by him．Such，for instance，are the questions （pucchā） of ālavaka and Sabhiya and the stanzas taught to Sutasoma by the brahmin Nanda of Takkasilā （J．v．476f； 453）．The Mittavinda Jātaka （No．104） is mentioned as belonging to the days of Kassapa Buddha （J．i．413）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMention is also made of doctrines which had been taught by Kassapa but forgotten later，and Gotama is asked by those who had heard faint echoes of them to revive them （E．g．，MA，i．107，528； AA．i．423）．A sermon attributed to Kassapa，when he once visited Benares with twenty thousand monks，is included in the story of Pandita-Sāmanera （DhA．ii．127ff）．It was on this occasion that Kassapa accepted alms from the beggar Mahāduggata in preference to those offered by the king and the nobles．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKassapa held the uposatha only once in six months （DhA．iii．236）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBetween the times of Kassapa and Gotama the surface of the earth grew enough to cover Sūkarakata-lena （MA．ii．677）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe records of Chinese pilgrims contain numerous references to places connected with Kassapa．Hiouien Thsang speaks of a stūpa containing the relics of the whole body of the Buddha，to the north of the town，near Srāvasti，where，according to him，Kassapa was born （Beal，op．cit．，ii．13）．Mention is also made of a footprint of Kassapa （Ibid．i．，Introd．ciii）．Stories of Kassapa are also found in the Divyāvadāna （E．g．，pp．22f； 344f； 346f； see also Mtu．，e．g．，i．59，303f）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dhammapada Commentary （iii．250f ） contains a story，which seems to indicate that，near the village of Todeyya，there was a shrine thought to be that of Kassapa and held in high honour by the inhabitants of the village．After the disappearance of Kassapa’s Sāsana，a class of monks called Setavattha-samanavamsa （”white-robed recluses”） tried to resuscitate it，but without success （VibhA．432）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e2．Kassapa Thera．\u003c/i\u003e-The son of an Udicca-brahmin of Sāvatthi，who died when Kassapa was still young．Having heard the Buddha preach at Jetavana，he entered the First Fruit of the Path and，with his mother’s leave，became a monk．Some time later，wishing to accompany the Buddha on a tour after the rains，he went to bid his mother farewell，and her admonition to him on that occasion helped him to win insight and become an arahant （Thag．v．82）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Padumuttara Buddha he had been a brahmin versed in the Vedas．One day，seeing the Buddha and wishing to pay homage，he cast a handful of sumana-flowers into the air over the Buddha’s head，and the flowers formed a canopy in the sky．In later births he was twenty-five times king，under the name of Cinnamāla （v．l．Cittamāla）．（ThagA．i．177f ）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably identical with Sereyyaka Thera of the Apadāna．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e3．Kassapa．\u003c/i\u003e-A devaputta．He visited the Buddha late one night at Jetavana and uttered several stanzas，admonishing monks to train themselves in their tasks，laying particular stress on the cultivation of Jhāna （S．i．46）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa says （SA．i．82） that Kassapa had heard the Buddha preach the Abhidhamma in Tāvatimsa．Having heard only a portion of the doctrine and not being sure of the admonition given by the Buddha to the monks regarding the practice of Jhāna-vibhanga，Kassapa thought he could supply the omission．The Buddha，knowing his capabilities，allowed him to give his views，and expressed his approval at the end of Kassapa’s speech．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e4．Kassapa．\u003c/i\u003e-A

A．C．）．Fearing the revenge of his brother Moggallāna，he erected the fortress at Sīhagiri and dwelt there．Later，repenting of his patricide，he did many meritorious deeds by way of amends （for details see Cv．xxxix．8ff），chief of which was the restoration of the Issarasamanārāma，to which he added buildings named after his daughters，Bodhī and Uppalavannā．In a fight with his brother’s forces his army fled

edifices to provide for his army （Cv．xliv．137f）．On Aggabodhi’s death in exile in Rohana，Kassapa defeated Dāthopatissa，who claimed the throne，and became king in his place （Kassapa II．641-50）．He did not，however，wear a crown，the regalia having probably been stolen．As king he repented of his former misdeeds and did various acts of merit （Cv．xliv．147ff； xlv．1ff）．He paid special honour to Mahādhammakathī Thera of Nāgasālā and to the Thera of Katandhakāra．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis children all being young at the time of his death，he entrusted the government to his sister’s

ruler of Ceylon as Kassapa V．（probably 913-23 A．C．） （Cv．lii．37ff）．He is sometimes referred to as the son of the twice-consecrated queen （dvayābhisekajāta），his mother being Sanghā，daughter of

country called Pollanka，where the people grew very fond of him and where he became known as Pollanka Thera．Some time later he was crossing to Ceylon and the vessel in which he was refused to move．Lots were drawn，as it was necessary to discover who aboard the vessel was the sinner．The lot fell repeatedly on Kassapa，because，in a former life，he had harassed a dog in the water．He was accordingly thrown overboard，but was rescued by Sakka，in the form of a crocodile．The thera reached Yakkhadīpa （q．v．） and there，as a result of practising compassion，the blind yakkhas gained their sight．Kassapa went later to Sīhaladīpa，whence he returned home with relics and seeds of the Bodhi-tree and models of the Mahācetiya and Lohapāsāda．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e27．Kassapa\u003c/i\u003e．-The name is
