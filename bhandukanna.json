[["V","Bhandukanna：A juggler，who tried to make Mahāpanāda laugh．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe made a mango tree，the Atulamba，grow before the palace door and climbed it with the help of a string．Vessavana’s slaves chopped him up and threw the pieces down，and the other jugglers joined the pieces together and poured water over them．Bhandukanna then donned upper and under garments of flowers and started dancing again．But he could not make Mahāpanāda laugh．J．iv．324．"]]
