[["V","Godatta Sutta：A conversation between Godatta and Cittagahapati at the Ambātakavana in Macchikāsanda．Godatta asks Citta about the different kinds of heart’s release （cetovimutti） - appamānācetovimutti，ākiñcaññācetovimutti，suññatocetovimutti and animittācetovimutti．Citta explains them and points out how，according to one view，these states are diverse both in spirit and in letter and how，according to another，they are the same in spirit，though diverse in letter．S.iv.295f."]]
