[["V","Mahāsakuludāyī Sutta：The Buddha visits the hermitage of Sakuludāyī near Rājagaha．Sakuludāyi tells him that the Buddha，unlike other religious teachers，is honoured by his disciples，and gives it as his opinion that this is because the Buddha eats sparingly，is content with any raiment，accepts any alms，is satisfied with any lodging，lives in seclusion，and counsels others to do likewise．The Buddha answers that if the esteem shown him depends on these qualities，he has numerous disciples more austere than himself with regard to these practices，and gives five other qualities which have won for him esteem：he has the higher virtues，outstandingly keen vision，super eminent intellect，he teaches his disciples the Noble Truths，and shows them the way in which to develop the four satipatthāna． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe has taught them，besides， \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  the sammā-ppadhāna，   the four iddhi-pāda，     the five indriyas，     the five bala，     the seven bojjhangas，    the Noble Eightfold Path，（magga）  the eight Deliverances （vimokkha），    the eight spheres of mastery （abhibhāyatamas），   the ten kasināyatanas，     the four jhānas，     the sixfold abhiññā．   It is for these reasons that his disciples esteem him．M．ii．1-22．"]]
