[["V","Bhadraghata Jātaka：Once the Bodhisatta was a rich merchant with an only son．He did great good and was born as Sakka．The son squandered all his wealth in drinking and amusements and fell into poverty．Sakka took pity on him and gave him the Bhadraghata （Wishing Cup），asking him to take care of it．But one day，when the son was drunk，he threw the cup into the air and smashed it，thus reducing himself once again to misery．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to a ne’er-do-well nephew ofAnāthapindika．His uncle helped him again and again，but he squandered everything，and one day Anāthapindika had him turned out of his house．The two squanderers were the same．J．ii．431f．"]]
