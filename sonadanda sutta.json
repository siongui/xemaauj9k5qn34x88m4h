[["V","Sonadanda Sutta：The fourth Sutta of the Dīgha Nikāya．It records the discussion between the Buddha andSonadanda．The Buddha asks him what things enable a man to make a just claim to be a brahmin and Sonadanda answers him．The Buddha makes him admit that birth is of no importance，only the good life matters．The Buddha then teaches him what is meant by the good life in the Buddha’s own doctrine，in very much the same way as in that of theSāmaññaphala Sutta．D．i．111ff．"]]
