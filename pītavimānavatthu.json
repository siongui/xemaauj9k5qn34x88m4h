[["V","Pītavimānavatthu：The story of a woman of Rājagaha．When Ajātasattu erected a thūpa over the Buddha’s relics at Rājagaha，she started early one morning with four kosātakī flowers to offer at the thūpa．On the way there she was gored to death by a cow，and was reborn in Tāvatimsa，wearing yellow garments．There Moggallāna met her and learned her story．Vv．iv．9； VvA．200f．"]]
