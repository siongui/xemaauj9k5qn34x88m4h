[["V","Dhonasākha Jātaka：Once a prince of Benares，named Brahmadatta，learned the arts from the Bodhisatta，then a teacher atTakkasilā．The teacher （Pārāsariya），having observed his character，warned him against harshness and counselled him to be gentle．In due course，Brahmadatta became king，and on the advice of his chaplain，Pingiya，went out at the head of a large army and captured alive one thousand kings．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe could not，however，take Takkasilā，and Pingiya suggested that a sacrifice be offered，to take the form of blinding the captive kinks and letting their blood flow round the rampart．This was done； but when Brahmadatta went to bathe，a Yakkha tore out his right eye，and，as be lay down，a sharp-pointed bone，dropped by a vulture，blinded his left eye．He died in agony and was born in hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to Bodhirājakumāra who blinded the architect of his palace （Kokanada），lest he should build another as grand．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBodhi is identified with Brahmadatta and Devadatta with Pingiya （J.iii.157.161）."]]
