[["V","Kalyāni：A monastery attached to the Kalyāni-cetiya．It was from the earliest times the residence of eminent monks，such as Dhammagutta （the Earth-shaker） and his five hundred colleagues （Mhv．xxxii．51） and of Godattatthera （MA．i．100）．Here a thera，called Pindapātiya，once recited the Brahmajāla Sutta，and the earth trembled as he finished his recital （DA．i．131）．Near the vihāra was the village of Kāladīghavāpigāma，where monks who lived in the monastery went for alms （SnA．i．70； AA．i．13）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKing Kanittha-Tissa built in this monastery an uposatha-hall （Mhv．xxxvi．17）．Vijayabāhu III．restored the vihāra，which had been damaged by the Damilas，and reconstructed the cetiya，crowning it with a golden finial．He also built a gate-tower on the eastern side （Cv．lxxxi．59f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the fourteenth century Alagakkonāra seems to have bestowed great patronage on the monastery，and to have done many things for its improvement （See Ceylon Antiquary and Literary Register i．152； ii．149，182）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven in the fifteenth century the monastery was evidently considered one of the chief centres of the Sangha in Ceylon，for we find that the monks，sent by Dhammaceti from Rāmañña to Ceylon，received their ordination in the sīmā of Kalyāni-vihāra，and that on their return they consecrated a sīmā in Pegu known as the Kalyāni-sīmā （Bode，op．cit．，38）．"],["V","Kalyāni：The cetiya built on the spot where the Buddha preached to Maniakkhika and his followers （Mhv．i．75f）．According to tradition it enshrined the throne on which the Buddha sat，and has been a place of pilgrimage from that day to this （See，e．g．，VibbA．295； MA．ii．701）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVohārika-Tissa erected a parasol on the cetiya （Mhv．xxxvi．34）．（See also Kalyāni-vihāra．）"]]
