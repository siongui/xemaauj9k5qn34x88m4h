[["V","Vātaggasindhava Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was once born as the state horse of the king of Benares，his name being Vātaggasindhava．A she ass，Kundalī，fell in love with him and refused to eat．Her son discovered this，and made the horse agree to come and see her after his bathe．But when the horse came，Kundalī，not wishing to make herself cheap，kicked him on the jaw and nearly killed him．The horse was ashamed and did not repeat his visit，and Kundalī died of love．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told to a landowner of Sāvatthi，with whom a beautiful woman fell desperately in love．Her friends，with great difficulty，persuaded him to visit her one night，but she was capricious and rejected his advances．He went away never to return，and she died of love．When he heard of her death，he sought the Buddha，who told him the story．The she ass is identified with the woman．J．ii．337ff．\t"]]
