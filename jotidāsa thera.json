[["V","Jotidāsa Thera：A wealthy brahmin of Pādiyattha （Pāniyattha）．One day，seeing Mahā Kassapa going for alms，he entertained the Elder and requested him to preach．On a hill near the village Jotidāsa built a vihāra for Kassapa and provided him with the requisites．Moved by the Elder’s teaching，he left the world and soon after became an arahant．After ten years - during which he learnt the Three Pitakas，being specially proficient in the Vinaya - while on his way to Sāvatthi to see the Buddha，he entered a Paribbājakārāma，and there had a discussion with the Paribbājakas on how to burn away evil．At the end of the discussion，they were ordained under him．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Sikhī Buddha he was a householder and，seeing the Buddha，offered him a kāsumārika-fruit （Thag．143-4； ThagA．i．264f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably identical with Kāsumāraphaladāyaka of the Apadāna ii．445．But see Sīvaka．"]]
