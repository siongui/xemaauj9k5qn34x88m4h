[["V","Dhammavihārī Sutta：Two suttas on the same theme．The monk worthy to be called a dhammavihārī is not one who has mastered the Dhamma nor one who teaches it to others，neither is he one who repeats it by heart nor who reflects on it，but he is one who，having learnt the Dhamma，dwells apart and devotes himself to attaining calmness of self．A.iii.86."]]
