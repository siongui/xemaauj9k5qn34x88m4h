[["V","Uddesavibhanga Sutta：The Buddha utters the brief statement that a monk should always so guard his mind that it may not be externally diffused nor internally set．The monks repeat this statement to Mahā Kaccāna，who gives a detailed exposition thereof．When the Buddha is told of Kaccāna’s explanation，he praises his erudition （M．iii．223ff）．"]]
