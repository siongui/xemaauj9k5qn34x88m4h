[["V","Thapatayo Sutta：The royal chamberlains，Isidatta and Purina，staying at Sādhuka，hear that the Buddha is in the village and，waiting for him，follow him till he sits down under a tree．They tell him of their joy that he is staying near them．They are proud in telling him that in spite of the temptations placed in their way in the performance of their duties，they are free from thoughts of lust．The Buddha tells them they are possessed of the four qualities of Sotāpannas and should，therefore，be thankful for their good fortune．S．v．348ff．"]]
