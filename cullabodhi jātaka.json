[["V","Cullabodhi Jātaka：The Bodhisatta，under the name of Bodhi （he is also referred to as Culla-bodhi），was once born in a very rich family of Kāsi and studied in Takkasilā．His parents married him to a suitable wife but，because they had both come from the Brahma-world，they were free from passionate desire．After his parents’ death，the two distributed their wealth and became ascetics．One day they came to the king’s park，and there the king fell in love with the woman and carried her away by force to the palace．When he told the Bodhisatta of this，he showed no resentment whatever．In the palace the king found that he could not win the woman’s love，and returned to the park，curious to know whether the ascetic really meant what he said．In the course of conversation the Bodhisatta told the king that he did not give way to anger because anger，once awakened，is difficult to curb.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to a monk of violent temper．The king wasAnanda and the Bodhisatta’s wife wasRāhulamātā．（J.iv.22-27．Cf．theAnanusociya Jātaka）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is also given in the Jātakamālā as the Khudda-bodhi Jātaka （No.xxi），and in the Cariyāpitaka．Cyp.，p.86."]]
