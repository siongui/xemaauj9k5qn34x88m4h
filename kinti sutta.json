[["V","Kinti Sutta：Preached at Baliharana in Kusinārā．The Buddha tells the monks that they should school themselves in the higher lore taught by him，such as the satipatthāna，iddhipāda，etc．，and lays down rules on the treatment of monks who dispute about the meaning and letter of the Doctrine and of those who are guilty of transgressions．The sutta derives its name from the first words （kinti） uttered by the Buddha in beginning the sermon．M．ii．238ff"]]
