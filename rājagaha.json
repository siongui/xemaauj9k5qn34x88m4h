 Bārhadrathapura （ii．24，44），Varāha，Vrsabha，Rsigiri，Caityaka （see PHAI．，p．70）． \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was also called Bimbisārapurī and Magadhapura （SNA．ii．584）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut both names were used indiscriminately （E．g．，S．N．vs．405），though Giribbaja seems，as a name，to have been restricted to verse passages．The place was called Giribbaja （mountain stronghold） because it was surrounded by five hills -  Pandava，Gijjhakūta，Vebhāra，Isigili and Vepulla* - and Rājagaha，because it was the seat of many kings，such as Mandhātā and Mahāgovinda （SNA．ii．413）．It would appear，from the names given of the kings，that the city was a very ancient royal capital．In the Vidhurapandita Jātaka （J．vi．271），Rājagaha is called the capital of Anga．This evidently refers to a time when Anga had subjugated Magadha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  * SNA．ii．382； it is said （M．iii．68） that these hills，with the exception of   Isigili，were once known by other names e．g．，Vankaka for Vepulla （S．ii．191）．  The Samyutta （i．206） mentions another peak near Rājagaha -  Indakūta．See   also Kālasilā．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Commentaries （E．g．，SNA．loc．cit） explain that the city was inhabited only in the time of Buddhas andCakkavatti kings； at other times it was the abode of Yakkhas who used it as a pleasure resort in spring．The country to the north of the hills was known as Dakkhināgiri （SA．i．188）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRājagaha was closely associated with the Buddha’s work．He visited it soon after the Renunciation，journeying there on foot from the River Anomā，a distance of thirty leagues （J．i．66）．Bimbisāra saw him begging in the street，and，having discovered his identity and the purpose of his quest，obtained from him a promise of a visit to Rājagaha as soon as his aim should be achieved （See the Pabbajjā Sutta and its Commentary）．During the first year after the Enlightenment therefore，the Buddha went to Rājagaha fromGayā，after the conversion of the Tebhātika Jatilas．Bimbisāra and his subjects gave the Buddha a great welcome，and the king entertained him and a large following of monks in the palace．It is said that on the day of the Buddha’s entry into the royal quarters，Sakka led the procession，in the guise of a young man，singing songs of praise of the Buddha．It was during this visit that Bimbisāra gifted Veluvana to the Order and that the Buddha received Sāriputta and Moggallāna as his disciples．（Details of this visit are given in Vin．i．35ff ）．Large numbers of householders joined the Order，and people blamed the Buddha for breaking up their families．But their censure lasted for only seven days．Among those ordained were the Sattarasavaggiyā with Upāli at their head．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Buddha spent his first vassa in Rājagaha and remained there during the winter and the following summer．The people grew tired of seeing the monks everywhere，and，on coming to know of their displeasure，the Buddha went first to Dakkhināgiri and then to Kapilavatthu （Vin．i．77ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAccording to the Buddhavamsa Commentary （p．13），the Buddha spent also in Rājagaha the third，fourth，seventeenth and twentieth vassa．After the twentieth year of his teaching，he made Sāvatthi his headquarters，though he seems frequently to have visited and stayed at Rājagaha．It thus became the scene of several important suttas -  e．g．，the Atānātiya，Udumbarika and Kassapasīhanāda，Jīvaka，Mahāsakuladāyī，and Sakkapañha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor other incidents in the Buddha’s life connected with Rājagaha，see Gotama．The most notable of these was the taming of Nālāgiri．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of the Vinaya rules were enacted at Rājagaha．Just before his death，the Buddha paid a last visit there．At that time，Ajātasattu was contemplating an attack on the Vajjians，and sent his minister，Vassakāra，to the Buddha at Gijjhakūta，to find out what his chances of success were （D．ii．72）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the Buddha’s death，Rājagaha was chosen by the monks，with Mahā Kassapa at their head，as the meeting place of the First Convocation．This took place at the Sattapanniguhā，and Ajātasattu extended to the undertaking his whole hearted patronage （Vin．ii．285； Sp．i．7f．； DA．i．8f．，etc．）．The king also erected at Rājagaha a cairn over the relics of the Buddha，which he had obtained as his share （D．ii．166）．According to the Mahā Vamsa，（Mhv．xxxi．21； MT．564） some time later，acting on the suggestion of Mahā Kassapa，the king gathered at Rājagaha seven donas of the Buddha’s relics which had been deposited in various places -  excepting those deposited at Rāmagāma -  and built over them a large thūpa．It was from there that Asoka obtained relics for his vihāras．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRājagaha was one of the six chief cities of the Buddha’s time，and as such，various important trade routes passed through it．The others cities were Campā，Sāvatthi，Sāketa，Kosambī and Benares （D．ii．147）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe road from Takkasilā to Rājagaha was one hundred and ninety two leagues long and passed through Sāvatthi，which was forty five leagues from Rājagaha．This road passed by the gates of Jetavana （MA．ii．987； SA．i．243）．The Parāyana Vagga （SN．vss．1011-3） mentions a long and circuitous route，taken by Bāvarī’s disciples in going from Patitthāna to Rājagaha，passing through Māhissati，Ujjeni，Gonaddha，Vedisā．Vanasavhaya，Kosambī，Sāketa，Sāvatthi，Setavyā，Kapilavatthu，Kusinārā，on to Rājagaha，by way of the usual places （see below）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom Kapilavatthu to Rājagaha was sixty leagues （AA．i．115； MA．i．360）．From Rājagaha to Kusinārā was a distance of twenty five leagues （DA．ii．609），and the Mahā Parinibbāna Sutta （D．ii．72ff ） gives a list of the places at which the Buddha stopped during his last journey along that road  -Ambalatthikā，Nālandā，Pātaligāma （where he crossed the Ganges），Kotigāma，Nādikā （??），Vesāli，Bhandagāma，Hatthigāma，Ambagāma，Jambugāma，Bhoganagara，Pāvā，and the Kakuttha River，beyond which lay the Mango grove and the Sāla grove of the Mallas．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom Rājagaha to the Ganges was a distance of five leagues，and when the Buddha visited Vesāli at the invitation of the Licchavis，the kings on either side of the river vied with each other to show him honour．DhA．iii．439f．； also Mtu．i．253ff．； according to Dvy．（p．55） the Ganges had to be crossed between Rājagaha and Sāvatthi，as well，by boat，some of the boats belonging to the king of Magadha and others to the Licchavis of Vesāli．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe distance between Rājagaha and Nālandā is given as one league，and the Buddha often walked between the two （DA．i．35）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe books mention various places besides Veluvana，with its Kalandaka-nivāpa vihāra in and around Rājagaha -
