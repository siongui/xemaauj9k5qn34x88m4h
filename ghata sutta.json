[["V","Ghata Sutta：Sāriputta and Moggallāna are staying at the Kalanda-kanivāpa and，in the course of their conversation，it transpires that Moggallāna，exercising clairvoyance and clairaudience，had seen and heard the Buddha，then dwelling in Jetavana．The subject of his talk was consummate energy （āraddhaviriya）．Sāriputta declares that，in comparison with Moggallāna，he himself is like a mound of gravel set up alongside the Himālaya．Moggallāna returns the compliment by saying that，beside Sāriputta，he is like a pinch of salt set up alongside a large jar of salt，and recalls the high praise bestowed on Sāriputta by the Buddha himself．S.ii.275f."]]
