[["V","Aparāditthi Sutta：A certain Brahmā thought that no recluse or brahmin could come to his world. To refute his views，the Buddha went there and sat in the air above the Brahmā，flames radiating from his body. The Buddha was followed by Moggallāna，Mahākassapa，Mahākappina and Anuruddha. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Brahmā was at first agitated by their presence，but later he was delighted on learning from Moggallāna，who was questioned by an attendant Brahmā，that there were many more disciples of the Buddha who could do as he and the others had done，and that they were holy men. S.i.144-6. See also Bakabrahma Sutta."]]
