[["V","Daddabha Jātaka：Once a timid hare lying at the foot of a vilva tree heard a vilva fruit fall on a palm-leaf and，imagining that the world was collapsing，started to run．Other animals，alarmed by the sight，ran also until all the beasts of the forest were in headlong flight．The Bodhisatta，born as a lion，heard their story and calmed their fears.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to a question asked of the Buddha by some monks，as to various austerities practised by ascetics．J.iii.74ff．The Jātaka is quoted at MA.i.313f."]]
