[["V","Hatthārohaputta Thera：He was born in the family of an elephant driver of Sāvatthi and became expert in elephant lore．One day，while training an elephant by the river，he felt that it would be better if he were to train himself．So he went to the Buddha，heard him preach，and，having entered the Order，attained arahantship （Thag.vs.77； ThagA.i.170f）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the time of Vipassī Buddha he was a householder．Having seen the Buddha，he offered him flowers and paid him homage．Forty one kappas ago he was a king，named Varana．He is probably identical with Ganthipupphiya Thera of the Apadāna．Ap.i.162."]]
