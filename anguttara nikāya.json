[["V","Anguttara Nikāya：The fourth division of the Sutta Pitaka，consisting of eleven nipātas （sections） and 9，557 suttas （A.v.361； DA.i.23； Gv.56）. The suttas are arranged in numbered lists，probably as aids to memory. Thus we find set out in order first the units，then the pairs，the trios etc.，up to groups of eleven. This method of arrangement has evidently influenced the subject matter as well，for we seldom see any reasoned arguments. The lists are often curtly given and curtly explained （See also Hardy’s remarks，A.v. introd. p.vii）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the first Council Anuruddha was asked to be the custodian of this Nikāya of 120 bhānavāras and to read it to his pupils （DA.i.15； Mbv.94）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the Buddha’s religion fades away，the first portion of the Sutta Pitaka to disappear will be the Anguttara Nikāya from the eleventh section to the first，and in that order （MA.881）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was also sometimes called \u003ci\u003eEkuttara\u003c/i\u003e. Mil. 392. It is worthy of note that the Ekottarāgama Sutra of the Chinese is unlike the Anguttara Nikaya （A.i. introd. ix.，n.4）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Anguttara Nikaya quotes the Parāyana，which is evidence of its late compilation. （i.133 and 134； ii.45. For other quotations in and from the Anguttara Nikaya see A.v.，introd. p.ix.，nn. 3 and 4.）\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Commentary to the Anguttara Nikāya is called Manorathapūranī."]]
