[["V","Bīrānī：A goddess （devadhītā）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe had a palace in the Cātummahārājika world which Nimi saw on his visit to heaven when he learnt her story from Mātali．In the time of Kassapa Buddha she had been a slave in a brahmin’s house．The brahmin，whose name was Asoka，invited eight monks to feed daily at his house and asked his wife to arrange to feed them at a cost of one kahāpana each．This she refused to do as did also his daughters; but their slave agreed to carry out this work，and she did it most conscientiously and with great devotion．As a result she was reborn in heaven （J．vi．117f）．Her palace was twelve leagues in height and one in extent; it possessed nine storeys and one thousand rooms．When Dutthagāmanī wished to erect the Lohapāsāda，he asked the monks for a plan，and eight arahants went to the deva world and returned with a plan of Bīranī’s palace．Mhv．xxvii．9ff．"]]
