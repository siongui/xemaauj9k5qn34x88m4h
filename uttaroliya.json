[["V","Uttaroliya：A village in Ceylon，in Rājarattha．Near it was Uttaroliyavāpi．The Rasavāhinī has a story of a cowherd boy of the village who gave his rice cake to a pindaptāika-thera．The monk developed arahantship before eating it．In his next birth the boy was born in the same village．By virtue of his merit，a treasure trove appeared in the lake，which no one could get except his mother．The king heard of it，and，having tested the truth of the story，gave it to the boy．Ras．ii．22f．\t"]]
