[["V","Kitāgiri Sutta：Preached at Kitāgiri to the Assajipunabbasukā，who were reported to the Buddha as having ridiculed the idea that they should themselves have only one meal a day because the Buddha and his devoted disciples did so．The Buddha sent for them and impressed on them that all his teachings were based on experience and knowledge and should therefore be followed by them．Chaffering such as their’s was not seemly in the seeker after truth （M．i．473ff）．"]]
