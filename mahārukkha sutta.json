[["V","Mahārukkha Sutta：In him who contemplates enjoyment in things which make for grasping （upādana），craving grows with its consequent round of suffering，like juice which travels upwards from the roots of a tree．If he contemplates the misery of such things，craving ceases，like the growth of a tree which is cut in pieces and burnt to ashes．S．ii．87f．"]]
