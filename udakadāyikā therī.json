[["V","Udakadāyikā Therī：An arahant．In a previous birth she was a water-carrier and maintained her children on her wages．Having nothing else to give，she regularly provided water in a bath for others．As a result，she was born in heaven and was fifty times queen of the deva-king and twenty times queen of kings on earth．She could produce rain at will，and her body knew neither heat nor dirt．Ap．ii．521-2．"]]
