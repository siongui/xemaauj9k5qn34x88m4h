[["V","Vattakālaka：A village near Girikandaka vihāra．A girl of this village soared into the sky by the power of her rapture when thinking of the Buddha．Her parents went to the monastery，leaving her at home as she was unfit to walk．From her home she saw the monastery lighted up and heard the monks chanting，and was so filled with rapture that she was transported to the vihāra．Vsm．i．143f．； DhSA．116．\t"]]
