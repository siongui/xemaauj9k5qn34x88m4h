[["V","Timsamatta Sutta：Thirty monks from Pāvā （described as Pāveyyakā），all forest-dwellers，visit the Buddha at Rājagaha．By means of various similes the Buddha tells them of the infiniteness of samsāra，and at the end of the sermon they become arahants （S．ii．187f ）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Dhammapada Commentary （DhA．ii．32f） evidently refers to the same monks，but there it is stated that the Buddha first preached to them in the Kappāsikavanasanda while they were searching for a woman．We seem here to have a confusion of legends．cp．the Bhaddavaggiyas．"]]
