[["V","Takka Jātaka：Once the Bodhisatta was an ascetic on the banks of the Ganges，from which he rescued Dutthakumārī，daughter of the setthi of Benares，who had been thrown into the flood during a storm by her long-suffering servants．The ascetic succumbed to the wiles of Dutthakumārī and took up his abode with her in a village，where they earned their living by selling takka （curds or dates）．He therefore came to be called Takkapandita．One day the village was looted by robbers，and they carried the woman away together with their booty．Living happily with the robber chief，she feared that her former husband might come to claim her； she therefore sent for him with sweet words，planning to have him killed．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile being beaten by the robber-chief，Takkapandita kept repeating，”Ungrateful wretches，” and，on being asked the reason，related the story．The robber thereupon killed the woman．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnanda is identified with the robber-chief．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related to a passion-tossed monk （J．i．295-99）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Jātaka is sometimes referred to as the Takkāriya Jātaka，E．g．，J．v．446 （16）．"]]
