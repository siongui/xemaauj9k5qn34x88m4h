[["V","Kiñchanda Jātaka：A chaplain of the king of Benares，who took bribes and gave false judgments，is reborn to a state of suffering all day，but as a result of having given a mango fruit to a woman who was keeping the fast，he enjoys great glory throughout the night in a charming mango-grove．His king，who had become an ascetic，eats a mango which had been carried by the river from this grove，and wishes for some more．He is transported by a river nymph （Uppalavannā of this age） to the mango-grove，where he hears from his erstwhile chaplain the story of his alternate bliss and misery．The Buddha related the story to some of his lay disciples who were keeping the fast （J．v．1ff）．The king is identified with the Bodhisatta．"]]
