[["V","Dāthāvedhaka：The Mahāvamsa Tīkā mentions （MT.176） two theras of this name，one a resident of the Kurundacullaka-parivena，and the other of the Kolambahālaka-parivena．They lived in the time of Bhāgineyya Dāthopatissa，and about fifty years after the secession of the Sāgalikā from the Dhammaruci-nikāya they set up a school of their own，in which they borrowed the Ubhato-vihanga from the Dhammarucikas and the Khandaka and Parivāra from the Sāgalikas."]]
