[["V","Dīghajānu：A Koliyan，inhabitant of Kakkarapatta．There he visited the Buddha and asked for a teaching which would bring happiness both in this world and the next．The Buddha explained to him the four conditions of temporal welfare - utthāna-sampadā，ārakkha-sampadā，kalyānamittatā and samajīvitā．He then explained the four conditions of spiritual welfare - saddhā-sampadā，sīla-sampadā，cāga-sampadā and pañña-sampadā．In this discourse the Buddha addresses him as Byagghapajja （A.iv.281ff）．The Commentary （AA.ii.778） says this was a paveni-nāma，common to all Koliyans."]]
