[["V","Upaddha Sutta：Preached at the Sākyan township of Sakkara．Ananda mentions to the Buddha his view that half the holy life consists in friendship with the good．The Buddha says that it is not the half but the whole of the holy life，and proceeds to explain （S．v．2）．In the Kosala Samyutta （S．i．87） we find the Buddha relating this incident to Pasenadi．"]]
