[["V","Vāta Sutta：It is because of clinging to body，etc．that such views arise as that winds do not blow，pregnant women do not bring forth，the sun and moon neither rise nor set； but all these things are stable as a pillar．These vanish with the Ariyan disciple’s doubts regarding suffering，its cause，its cessation，and the way to such cessation．S．iii．202f．\t"]]
