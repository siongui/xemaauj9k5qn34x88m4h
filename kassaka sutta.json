[["V","Kassaka Sutta：Once the Buddha was at Sāvatthi preaching to the monks on nibbāna．Māra appears in the guise of a peasant，dishevelled，wearing hempen garments，with a mighty plough on his shoulder，and asks the Buddha if he has seen his oxen．The Buddha declares，unequivocally，that he has no eyes for things owned； having escaped completely from worldly desires，possessions and ownership，his mind furnishes no gateway for Māra．S．i．114．"]]
