[["V","Asāvatī：A creeper which grows in the Cittalatāvana in Tāvatimsa．In its fruit a divine drink is hidden，and they who drink of it once are intoxicated for four months and lie on a divine couch．It bears fruit only once in a thousand years，and the gods wait patiently for that period for a drink of the fruit．J．iii．250-1; Ap．i．41．"]]
