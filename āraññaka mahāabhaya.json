[["V","Āraññaka Mahāabhaya：A monk．For twelve years a devotee gave him his requisites including cloth for his robes; but a thief，Harantika，always stole the cloth．Discovering this，the devotee caught the rogue，beat him soundly，and，having tied him to a corpse，warned the villagers that a Yakkha would be prowling about that night，calling himself Harantika．The villagers fastened their doors and gave him no admission，even his wife refusing to recognise his voice．Then Harantika went to Mahāabhaya，and having confessed his guilt，asked for protection．Mahāabhaya bathed him in warm water and rubbed oil on his body，saying it was not his business to take revenge．Harantika later became a monk and attained arahantship．Ras．ii．5f．"]]
