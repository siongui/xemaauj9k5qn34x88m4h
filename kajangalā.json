[["V","Kajangalā：A nun who lived in Kajangala．Once when the Buddha was residing in the Veluvana there，the inhabitants of the village went to her and asked her to explain in detail what the Buddha had taught them in brief．This she did，and when the matter was reported to the Buddha，he praised her very highly （A．v．54ff）．The exposition given by her is quoted in the Khuddakapātha Commentary （pp．80，83，85）．Her story is given in detail in the Avadānasataka （ii．41ff）．"]]
