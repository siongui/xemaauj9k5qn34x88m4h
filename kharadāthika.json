[["V","Kharadāthika：A yakkha．The Bodhisatta，who became Mangala Buddha in one of his later births，left his kingdom and lived as a recluse in the forest with his wife and children．The yakkha，having heard of the Bodhisatta’s generosity，came to him，begged for his two children，and on being given them ate them in the sight of their father．Even when the blood flowed from the yakkha’s mouth the Bodhisatta remained unmoved，and wished that in the future there should issue from his own body rays of light，in colour like to streams of blood．As a result of this wish Mangala’s aura always spread throughout the ten thousand world systems，while that of other Buddhas spread as a rule only one fathom from their body．J．i．31； BuA．116f．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e     \u003c/i\u003e"]]
