[["V","Anumana Sutta：Preached by Mahāmoggallāna in the Bhesakalāvana atSumsumāragiri in theBhagga country. It deals with the admonishing of monks and with self-examination. It is of interest to note that there is no reference to the Buddha throughout the discourse （M.i.95-100）. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa says that this discourse was known to the Porānā as the Bhikkhupātimokkha，and adds that this self-examination should take place three times each day （MA.i.294）. The description of the evil-minded monk given in the Sutta is often quoted （E.g.，Sp. iii. 612）."]]
