[["V","Nakkhatta Jātaka：Two parties，having arranged a marriage，fix a day for it to take place．The bridegroom’s party consults their family ascetic who，piqued at not having been asked before，declares that the chosen day is unlucky．The bride’s families，after waiting a while，give their daughter to another．When the first bridegroom comes later to claim her，he is charged with lack of common courtesy and a wrangle ensues，which is settled by a wise man who points out that all the trouble is due to the foolish habit of consulting stars．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is related in reference to two parties of Sāvatthi whose plans are similarly thwarted by a naked ascetic．The characters in both stories are the same，says the Buddha．J．i．257 ff．"]]
