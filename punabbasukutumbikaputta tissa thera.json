[["V","Punabbasukutumbikaputta Tissa Thera：He was of Ceylon，and crossed over to India，where he studied under Yonaka Dhammarakkhita．On his way home by sea he felt doubtful of one word，and returned all the way，one hundred leagues，to consult his teacher．On the way from the port he mentioned the word to a householder，who was so pleased with him that he gave him a blanket and one hundred thousand．This blanket Tissa gave to his teacher，but the latter cut it up and used it as a spread，as an example to others （not to desire luxuries）．Tissa had his doubts set at rest and returned to Jambukola．There，at the Vālīkāvāma，as he was sweeping the courtyard of the cetiya，other monks asked him questions in order to vex him．But he was able to answer all these，having attained the patisambhidā．VibhA．389．"]]
