[["V","Mahāgosinga Sutta：A discussion in Gosingasālavana，between Sāriputta，Mahā Moggallāna，Mahā Kassapa，Anuruddha，Revata and Ananda．Sāriputta is visited by the others in the evening，and asks them what type of monk would illumine the Gosinga wood．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Ananda speaks of one who treasures what he has been taught and learns by   heart the doctrines which declare the higher life in all its perfection and   purity；   Revata of one who delights in meditation and lives in solitude；   Anuruddha of one who possesses the celestial eye；    Mahā Kassapa of one living in the forest a strenuous life，recommends that   life；   Moggallāna，of one who holds discussions with another on the Abhidhamma；   Sāriputta of a monk who is master of his heart and is not under its   mastery．They all seek the Buddha and ask for his opinion．He praises the opinion of each of the Elders，but he himself would choose a monk who is delivered from the āsavas．M．i．212-19．"]]
