[["V","Madhurapācikā：A woman of Sāvatthi，wife of a man who joined the Order in his old age with his friends．All these friends used to eat at his house，where they were well looked after．But the wife died，and they all lamented greatly．The Buddha heard of this，and sent for them and recited to them the Kāka Jātaka （q．v．） （J．i．497ff）．At the end of the discourse the aged monks all became sotāpannas．DhA．iii．422ff．"]]
