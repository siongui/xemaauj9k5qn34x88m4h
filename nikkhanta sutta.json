[["V","Nikkhanta Sutta：Once Vangīsa，soon after his ordination，was staying at the Aggālava-cetiya with his tutor，Nigrodha Kappa．During his tutor’s absence，a number of gaily dressed women came to the vihāra，and Vangīsa was greatly perturbed in mind．But he put forth great effort，and thinking of the loyalty he owed to the Buddha，conquered his disaffection．S．i．185f； the verses are also found in Thag．1209 13．"]]
