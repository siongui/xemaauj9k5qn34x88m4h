[["V","Paccanīka Sutta：Once the brahmin Paccanīkasāta of Sāvatthi visited   the Buddha and asked him to recite a doctrine．But the Buddha refused，saying   that there was no use in trying to teach one whose heart was corrupt and full   of animosity．This refusal seems to have pleased the brahmin．S．i．179．"]]
