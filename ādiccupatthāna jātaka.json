[["V","Ādiccupatthāna Jātaka：The story of a monkey who used to visit the hermitage of some ascetics whose leader was the Bodhisatta； when they were away in the village，he upset everything he could lay hands on，and did much damage generally. When the ascetics were about to return from the village to the hermitage after the rainy season，the people brought them various foods，and the monkey，thinking to get some for himself，stood outside their hut worshipping the sun. The people，impressed by the monkey’s holy demeanour，started praising his virtues，whereupon the Bodhisatta revealed to them his true character （J.ii.72-3）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related concerning a rogue."]]
