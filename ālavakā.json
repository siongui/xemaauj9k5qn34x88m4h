[["V","Ālavakā：A name given to the monks of ālavī.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa （Sp.iii.561） says that all children born in ālavī were called ālavakā. The ālavakā-bhikkhū are mentioned several times in the Vinaya （ii.172ff.； iii.85； iv.34-5） in connection with offences relating to navakamma （repairing and reconstruction of buildings），and rules are laid down by the Buddha restricting these monks in their activities. Once when one of the monks was cutting down a tree which was the abode of a devata，the sprite was sorely tempted to kill him，but restraining her wrath she sought the Buddha and complained to him. The Buddha praised her forbearance and preached the Uraga Sutta （SnA.i.4-5）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the introductory story of the Manikantha Jātaka （J.ii.282-3） it is stated that the importunities of these monks so annoyed the residents of ālavī that they fled at the approach of any yellow-robed monk."]]
