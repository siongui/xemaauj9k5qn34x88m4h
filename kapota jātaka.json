[["V","Kapota Jātaka：1．Kapota Jātaka （No．42）．-Once the Bodhisatta was born as a pigeon and lived in a straw basket hung in the kitchen of the setthi of Benares．A crow，sniffing the savour of the food being cooked in the kitchen and longing to taste it，struck up a friendship with the pigeon in order to gain admission．In the evening，having searched for his food in the pigeon’s company，he accompanied him home，and the setthi’s cook，on seeing him，provided a basket for him．One day，seeing some fish being prepared，the crow feigned illness and stayed behind in his basket，in spite of the warnings of the pigeon，who suspected his real reason．The cook caught the crow stealing a piece of fish and，in order to punish him，plucked his feathers and soused him in a pickle of ginger and salt and cumin mixed with sour butter-milk．The pigeon，on his return，found him in this state and，having learnt his story，flew away，not wishing to live there any more．The crow died and was flung on the dust heap．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related in reference to a greedy monk who was identified with the crow．J．i．241ff\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2．Kapota Jātaka （No．375）．-The same as above，except for a few details．When the theft was discovered，the cook made a mixture of moist ginger and white mustard，pounded with a rotten date，and after wounding the crow with a potsherd，rubbed the stuff into the wound and fastened the potsherd round its neck．J．iii．224ff"]]
