[["V","Ahimsaka Bhāradvāja：One of the Bhāradvāja brothers. He came to the Buddha at Sāvatthi and the Buddha suggested to him the desirability of living up to his name by practising ahimsā. It is said that later he became an arahant （S.i.164）. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuddhaghosa （SA.i.179） is uncertain as to the reason for the name which he says was given to him by the Recensionists. He suggests that he was so called，either because his actual name was such，or because of the nature of the discussion between him and the Buddha."]]
