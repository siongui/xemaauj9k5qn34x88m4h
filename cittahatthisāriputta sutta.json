[["V","Cittahatthisāriputta Sutta：A number of Elders* were talking on the Abhidhamma in the Migadāya in Isipatana，when Citta-Hatthisāriputta broke into their talk．Mahā Kotthita rebuked him，and，on being remonstrated with by Citta’s friends，Mahā Kotthita implied by means of various similes that Citta was not the wise man they thought him to be，and that he would，without doubt，return again to the lay life．This prediction proved true，but Citta came back once more to the Order，and shortly afterwards became an arahant （A.iii.392ff）.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The DA．（ii.378） which refers to this incident says that the talk took place between Moggallāna andKotthita."]]
