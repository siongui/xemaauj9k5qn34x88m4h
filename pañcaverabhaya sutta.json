[["V","Pañcaverabhaya Sutta：Preached at Jetavana to Anāthapindika．The Ariyan disciple is free from the fivefold guilty dread：he knows that he is not guilty of taking life，of theft，of wrong indulgence of the senses，of falsehood，of the use of intoxicants，and he is free from dread of the guilt attaching to these．He is also possessed of unwavering faith in the Buddha，the Dhamma and the Sangha，and sees the Ariyan truth of the Causal Law．He thus begets confidence regarding his ultimate destiny．S．ii．68ff．"]]
