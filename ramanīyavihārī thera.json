[["V","Ramanīyavihārī Thera：An arahant．He was the son of a banker of Rājagaha and lived a dissolute life，till one day，on witnessing the arrest of an adulterer，he was very agitated and joined the Order．As a monk，too，he lived in luxury，in a well furnished room hence his name．Later，seized with remorse，he wandered out of his cell．On the way he saw a carter refresh a weary bull and then re-yoke him．Determined to take up his duties as a monk，he sought Upāli，and，with his help，attained arahantship．In the past he had offered koranda flowers to Vipassī Buddlha （Thag．vs．45； ThagA．i．115f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHe is probably identical with Korandapupphiya Thera of the Apadāna．Fifty seven kappas ago he was a king named Vītamala．Ap．i．206．"]]
