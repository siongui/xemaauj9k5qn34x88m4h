[["V","Māpamādakandarā：A cave，probably not very far from Rājagaha．When the Buddha went on tour with the monks，some of the latter accompanied him as far as this cave and then turned back．To such monks the Buddha would say，”Mā pamajjittha” （Be not heedless）．From this fact the cave took its name．DhA．ii．167．"]]
