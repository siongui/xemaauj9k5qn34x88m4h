[["V","Cunda Sūkarika：A pork butcher near Veluvana．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor forty-five years he plied his trade，killing pigs in such a way as to retain the flavour of the flesh unimpaired．When death approached he saw before him the fires of Avīci and roared with pain．For seven days he grunted like a pig，crawling on all fours，and no one could prevent him．The monks told the Buddha of the noises they had heard when passing the butcher’s house，and the Buddha explained how retribution had fallen on Cunda commensurate with his wickedness．DhA.i.105ff"]]
