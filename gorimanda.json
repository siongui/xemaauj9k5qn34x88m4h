[["V","Gorimanda：A rich man of Mithilā．He had no children and was ugly； when he spoke saliva flowed from his mouth，and two beautiful women，standing beside him，wiped his face with blue lilies and threw them away．When revellers had no money wherewith to buy flowers，they would stand outside Gorimanda’s house and call out for him．When he leaned out of the window to ask what they wanted，his face had to be wiped with lilies and the lilies were then thrown away．The revellers picked them up，washed them，and wore them at their revels．J.vi.367f."]]
