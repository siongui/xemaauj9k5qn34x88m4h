[["V","Cankī Sutta：Cankī，with a large company of brahmins，visits theBuddha at Opasāda and finds him conversing with some eminent and aged brahmins．A young brahmin，called Kāpathika，frequently interrupts the conversation and is rebuked by the Buddha．Cankī tells the Buddha that the youth is a very clever scholar and obtains for him a chance of questioning the Buddha．The Buddha declares that the brahmin pretensions to possess the sole truth are vain，and goes on to explain how a man can come to have faith in truth，then gain enlightenment with regard to it，and finally attain the truth itself by means of practice and development．At the end of the discourse Kāpathika declares himself a follower of the Buddha．M．ii．164ff"]]
