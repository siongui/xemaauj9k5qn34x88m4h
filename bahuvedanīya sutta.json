[["V","Bahuvedanīya Sutta：Pañcakanga asks Udāyi （Pandita Udāyī，says MA．ii．629） how many kinds of feelings theBuddha mentions．Udāyi answers that there are three：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  pleasant，  unpleasant and   indifferent．Pañcakanga，however，insists that there are but two：pleasant and unpleasant．Ananda，overhearing the conversation，reports it to the Buddha，who says that both Pañcakanga and Udāyi are correct because he himself classified feelings in various ways; sensual pleasures might be pleasant，but are not the highest pleasures; far better and more excellent are the pleasures enjoyed by a monk who develops the four jhānas，the plane of infinity of consciousness and the plane of nought．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eM．i．396ff．; the Sutta is repeated at S．iv．223ff．，under the name ofPañcakanga Sutta．"]]
