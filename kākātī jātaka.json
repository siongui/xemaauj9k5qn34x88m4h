[["V","Kākātī Jātaka：Kākātī was the chief queen of the King of Benares （the Bodhisatta）．A certainGaruda king came disguised as a man and played at dice with the king．Having fallen in love with Kākātī，the Garuda carried her off to his abode by the Simbalī-Lake and there lived with her．The king，missing his queen，sent his physician，Natakuvera，to look for her．The physician hid himself in the Garuda’s plumage and thus reached the palace where Kākātī was．There he enjoyed her favour and returned to Benares in the Garuda’s wing．While the Garuda and the king were playing at dice，Natakuvera sang a song telling of his experiences with Kākātī．The Garuda，realising what had happened，brought the queen back to Benares．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was related by the Buddha to a monk who was discontented on account of a woman．The monk is identified with Natakuvera （J．iii．90-2）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is among those related by the bird Kunāla，in theKunāla Jātaka．There （J．v．428） we learn that the Garuda’s name was Venateyya，who is identified with Kunāla．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Kākātī Jātaka very closely resembles theSussondī Jātaka．J．iii．187ff．"]]
