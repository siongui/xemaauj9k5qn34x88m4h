[["V","Gihi Sutta：On one occasion，when Anāthapindika comes to see the Buddha，the Buddha tells Sāriputta of the four kinds of clear consciousness （ābhicetasikadhamma） which come to the pious lay devotee who guards the five precepts - viz.，unwavering faith in the Buddha，Dhamma and Sangha，and the possession of Ariyan virtues．To him comes also the confidence that he is free from birth in a Niraya，among beasts or petas or in unhappy states，and that he is a sotāpanna．A.iii.211f."]]
