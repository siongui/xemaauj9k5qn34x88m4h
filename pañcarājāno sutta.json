[["V","Pañcarājāno Sutta：Once five rājās，with Pasenadi as their chief，were indulging in various forms of amusement and they fell to discussing among themselves as to which of the sense pleasures was the highest．Unable to come to any decision，they sought the Buddha，who explained that the highest pleasure，in the case of any of the senses，was the limit point in anyone’s enjoyment．A lay disciple，Candanangalika，who was present，thereupon rose from his seat and uttered a stanza in praise of the Buddha．The five rājās wrapped their robes around the disciple，and he，in turn，presented these to the Buddha．S．i．79f．"]]
