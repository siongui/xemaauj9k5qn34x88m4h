[["V","Pādalola Brahmadatta：King of Benares．He loved dancing，and had three houses in which young，middle aged，and old women danced respectively．One day he passed from one house to the other，and though the dancers put forth all their skill，the king failed to find satisfaction．Realizing that this discontent was the result of his craving，he left the world，developed insight，and became a Pacceka Buddha．His verse is included in the Khaggavisāna Sutta．SN．vs．61； SNA．i．113f．； ApA．i．158．"]]
