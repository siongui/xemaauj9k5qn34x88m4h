[["V","Unnābha：A brahmin．He once visited the Buddha atSāvatthi and asked him whether the five sense-faculties （indriyāni），which were of different scope and range，had any common ground of resort （pati-sarana）．The Buddha replies that the mind is their common resort and，in answer to further questions，explains that there is nothing beyond Nibbāna； that the holy life has Nibbāna for its ending．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen the brahmin，greatly pleased with the Buddha’s teaching，goes away，the Buddha tells the monks that Unnābha has become an anāgāmī and would，therefore，after death，no longer return to this world （S．v．217f）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe same Nikāya （S．v．272f） records a visit of Unnābha toAnanda at Kosambī．He asks Ananda what is the aim of holy life and，on being told that it is the abandoning of desire by means of jhāna，suggests that it would be a task without end．But Ananda，by means of an illustration，explains how the task does come to an end，and Unnābha expresses great satisfaction with the answer．Perhaps this refers to another brahmin of the same name．"]]
