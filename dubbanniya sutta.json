[["V","Dubbanniya Sutta：Once an ill-favoured yakkha came to be seated on Sakka’s throne．The gods of Tāvatimsa were greatly vexed on seeing him，but the greater their annoyance，the handsomer grew the yakkha．Then Sakka came up and showed great humility before the yakkha，and the greater his humility the uglier did the yakkha become，until he disappeared．S.i.237."]]
