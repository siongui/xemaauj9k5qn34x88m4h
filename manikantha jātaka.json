[["V","Manikantha Jātaka：The Bodhisatta and his younger brother，after the death of their parents，lived as ascetics in leaf huts on the Ganges，the elder being higher up the stream than the younger．One day，the Nāga king Manikantha，while walking along the river in the guise of a man，came to the hut of the younger ascetic and became his friend．Thereafter he called daily and their friendship grew apace．Manikantha finally became so fond of the ascetic that he put off his disguise，and encircling the other in his folds，lay thus for a short while each day，until his affection was satisfied．But the ascetic was afraid of his Nāga shape and grew thin and pale．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Bodhisatta noticing this，suggested that the next time Manikantha came，his brother should ask for the jewel which he wore round his throat．On the morrow，when the ascetic made this request，Manikantha hurried away．Several times this happened，and then he came no more．The ascetic was much grieved by his absence，but was comforted by the Bodhisiatta．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Buddha related this story at the Aggālava-cetiya near Alavi．The monks of Alavi became so importunate with their requests for building materials from the householders that at the mere sight of a monk the householders would hurry indoors．Mahā Kassapa discovered this and reported it to the Buddha，who admonished the monks against begging for things from other people．J．ii．282 6； also Vin．iii．146f．，where the details of the story of the past are slightly different．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the same occasion were preached the Brahmadatta Jātaka and the Atthisena Jātaka （q．v．）．"]]
