[["V","Suvannakakkata Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was a brahmin farmer of Sālindiya．On the way to his fields he passed a pond and grew friendly with a golden crab living in the pond．A she-crow longed to eat the farmer’s eyes，and persuaded her husband to induce a snake to bite the farmer．This he did，and，overcome with the poison，the farmer fell near the pool．Attracted by the noise，the crab emerged，and，seeing the crow about to peck out the farmer’s eyes，caught the crow with his claws．When the snake came to the rescue of the crow，the crab fastened on him too．The crab made the snake suck the poison from the farmer’s body，and，when he stood up，the crab crushed the necks of both the snake and the crow and killed them．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to Ananda’s attempt to save the Buddha from the elephant （Dhanapāla） sent byDevadatta to kill him，by standing between the elephant and the Buddha．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMāra was the serpent，Devadatta the crow，and Ananda，the crab．Ciñcāmānavikā was the female crow．J．iii．293-8．"]]
