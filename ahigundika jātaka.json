[["V","Ahigundika Jātaka：The story of a snake-charmer in Benares who had also a tame monkey. Once，during a festival，he left the monkey with a corn-factor （the Bodhisatta） and set out to earn money by making sport with the snake. The monkey was well looked after by the Bodhisatta. Seven days later the snake-charmer returned drunk and ill-treated the monkey. When the man was asleep the monkey escaped and refused to come back in spite of his former owner’s fine words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told with reference to a novice who was ordained by a distinguished Elder. The Elder ill-treated the lad who，in exasperation，left the Order. The Elder persuaded him to return，but when this had happened twice again，the lad refused to come back （J.iii.197-9）. The novice is identified with the monkey of the story."]]
