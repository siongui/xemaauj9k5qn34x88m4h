[["V","Gilāyana Sutta：As he is about to leave the Nigrodhārāma in Kapilavatthu to start on a tour，the Buddha is visited by Mahānāma，who asks him how a sick lay-disciple should be admonished．The Buddha answers that he should be asked to take comfort in his loyalty to the Buddha，the Dhamma and the Sangha，and in his possession of the Ariyan virtues．He should be shown the futility of longing for parents，children and sensual pleasures，and should be persuaded，if possible，to aspire not after rebirth，but after emancipation．S.v.408f."]]
