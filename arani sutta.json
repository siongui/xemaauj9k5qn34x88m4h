[["V","Arani Sutta：There are five indriyas：those of ease，discomfort，happiness，unhappiness and indifference．Just as from the rubbing together of two sticks warmth and heat are produced，so，from their separation，warmth and heat，thus born，are quenched; similarly from contact，experienced as agreeable，arises the faculty of ease （sukhindriya），etc．S．v．211-13．"]]
