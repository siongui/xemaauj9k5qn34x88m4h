[["V","Kassapasīhanāda Sutta：The eighth sutta of the Digha Nikāya．It consists of a dialogue between the Buddha and Acela-Kassapa on self-mortification，and contains an account of some of the practices prevalent among the ājīvakas．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Buddha claims that the insight and self-control and self-mastery of the arahant are much harder of attainment than the merely physical practices of the ascetics，which are far more evident to the vulgar．The Buddha states that self-mortification is an actual hindrance to spiritual development，for it turns a man’s mind from more essential matters．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is said that at the conclusion of the Sutta，Kassapa entered the Order and，in due course，became an arahant．D．i．161-77．"]]
