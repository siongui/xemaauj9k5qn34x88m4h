[["V","Pāricchattaka Sutta：Just as the devas in Tāvatimsa rejoice on seeing the Pāricchattaka tree gradually growing and putting forth flowers，and hold celebrations at each stage，so do they rejoice when the householder leaves the world and joins the Order，finally attaining to nibbāna．His fame spreads from world to world，even up to the Brahma world （A．iv．117ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sutta was evidently also known as the Pāricchattakopama．E．g．，AA．i．32； MA．i．14．"]]
