[["V","Mārakāyika devi：A group of devas，evidently followers of Māra，who were credited by the Pubbaseliyas and Aparaseliyas with making arahants discharge seminal fluid，though neither the arahants nor the devas themselves were guilty of physical impurity （Kvu．164f．）．One of these devas once entered the bodies of five hundred women，friends of Visākhā，made them drunk，and caused them to commit gross improprieties in the presence of the Buddha．DhA．iii．102．"]]
