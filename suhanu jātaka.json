[["V","Suhanu Jātaka：The Bodhisatta was minister to the king of Benares．The king had a wild horse called Mahāsona．The king was miserly，and one day，when some horse dealers brought horses for sale，he gave orders，unknown to his minister，that Mahāsona should be let loose among these horses，and that when he had bitten and weakened them，they should be bought at reduced price．The dealers complained to the minister．After inquiring into the matter，he advised them to bring Suhanu，a very strong horse they had，the next time they visited Benares．This they did，and when Mahāsona and Suhanu were confronted with each other they showed great affection，and started licking each other．The king saw this，and was told by his minister that the horses recognized each other’s virtues．He then warned the king against excessive covetousness．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to two hot headed monks，both passionate and cruel．One lived in Jetavana and the other in the country．One day the country monk came to Jetavana，and the monks eagerly awaited their quarrel．But when the two monks met they showed great affection．The Buddha explained that this was because of their like nature．J．ii．30-32．"]]
