[["V","Bāhiya Jātaka：Once Brahmadatta，king of Benares，saw from his window a fat and badly dressed woman relieving nature modestly and decently as she passed the courtyard of the palace when pressing need came upon her．The king was pleased with her quickness and decency，and having sent for her made her his chief queen．Their son became a Cakkavatti．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story was told in reference to the fat wife of a Licchavi prince．The monks expressed surprise that he should love her，but the Buddha pointed out that she was healthy and cleanly in her house （J．i．420 ff）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the course of the Jātaka，the woman is referred to as a bāhiyā，which the scholiast explains by bahijanapadavāsī．Bāhiya here，therefore，probably means ＂rustic．＂"]]
