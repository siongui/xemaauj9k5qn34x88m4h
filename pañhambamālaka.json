[["V","Pañhambamālaka：A place in Anurādhapura，where Devānampiyatissa offered Mahinda a mango，which he ate on the spot，and caused the seed to be planted．Immediately there sprouted from it a tall tree，bearing mangoes．This place later became the centre of distribution of various gifts to the monks （Mhv．xv．38）．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter Mahinda’s death，the bier containing his body was placed here for a week，and many honours were shown to it prior to its cremation （Ibid．，xx．39）．This is probably the same as Pañcambamālaka （q．v．）．"]]
