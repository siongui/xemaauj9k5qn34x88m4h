[["V","Attadattha Thera：When the Buddha announced that he would pass away in four months，many puthujjana-monks，out of affection for him，stayed near him，not knowing what to do．But Atthadattha，determined to realise the aim of his pabbajjā in the Buddha’s lifetime，dwelt apart，in earnest striving．His action was reported to the Buddha who，on learning what his purpose was，greatly praised him and held him up as an example to the others．At the end of the Buddha’s sermon the Thera became an arahant．DhA．iii．158-64．"]]
