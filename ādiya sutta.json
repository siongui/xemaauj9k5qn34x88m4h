[["V","Ādiya Sutta：Preached at Jetavana to Anāthapindika on the five uses （ādiyā） of possessions legitimately obtained：one enjoys them oneself； entertains with them one’s friends and relations； uses them in times of need； employs them in the discharge of one’s duties to the king，to religion，to one’s relations，both living and dead； and in doing good deeds which will bring happiness in future lives. A.iii.45f."]]
