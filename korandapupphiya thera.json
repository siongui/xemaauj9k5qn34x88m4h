[["V","Korandapupphiya Thera：1．Korandapupphiya Thera．-An arahant．Ninety-one kappas ago he saw the footprint of the Buddha Vipassī and offered to it a koranda-plant in bloom．Fifty-seven kappas ago he was a king named Vītamala （Ap．i．206）．He is probably to be identified with Ramanīyavihārī．ThagA．i．116．\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2．Korandapupphiya Thera．-An arahant．He was a woodsman in the time of Tissa Buddha，and having seen three footprints of the Buddha，he offered to him a flowering koranda-plant．In all subsequent births his skin was the colour of the koranda-flower．The same verses appear in two places in the Apadāna with very slight variations （Ap．ii．383，434）．Perhaps these are two distinct persons，because in the Theragāthā Commentary the verses appear twice - once under the name of Sugandha （ThagA．i．81） and once under that of Sabbamitta （ThagA．i．270）．"]]
