In Pug. 4 it is said：\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e＇What person is unshakable? If a person gains the meditative attainments of the fine-material and immaterial sphere （\u003ci\u003erūpāvacara-arūpāvacara\u003c/i\u003e）； and he gains them at his wish，without toil and exertion； and according to his wish，as regards place，object and duration，enters them or arises from them，then it is impossible that in such a person the attainments may become shaken through negligence. This person is unshakable."]]
