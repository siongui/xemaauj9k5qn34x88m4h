[["V","Andhakavenhu：Ten brothers，sons of Devagabbhā andUpasāgara.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it had been foretold at Devagabbhā’s birth that one of her sons would destroy the lineage of Kamsa，each time a son was born to her，fearing lest he be put to death，she sent him secretly to her serving-woman，Nandagopā； the latter had married Andhakavenhu and，by good fortune，daughters were born to her at the same time as sons to Devagabbhā； these daughters she sent to Devagabbhā in exchange for the latter’s sons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ten sons were named Vāsudeva，Baladeva，Candadeva，Suriyadeva，Aggideva，Varunadeva，Ajjuna，Pajjuna，Ghatapandita and Ankura. Cowell sees in this story the kernel of a nature-myth （Jātaka，trans. iv. 51 n. ）； cf. with this the Krsna legend in the Harivamsa； see also Wilson’s Visnu Purāna （Hall’s Ed.），v. 147f.； and the article on Krsna in Hopkins’ Epic Mythology，pp.214f. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey had also a sister，Añjanadevī. When they grew up they became highway robbers，seizing even a present sent to their uncle，King Kamsa. Thus they became notorious as the Andakavenhudāsaputtā. The king，having learnt of their true descent，devised various plans for their destruction. Two famous wrestlers，Cānura and Mutthika，were engaged to have a public wrestling match with them. The brothers accepted the challenge and looted several shops for clothes，perfumes，etc.，to be used for the occasion. Baladeva killed both the wrestlers. In his death-throes Mutthika uttered a prayer to be born as a Yakkha； his wish was fulfilled and he was born as such in the Kālamattiya forest. When the king’s men attempted to seize the brothers，Vāsudeva threw a wheel which cut off the heads of both the king and his brother the viceroy，Upakamsa.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe populace，terrified，begged the brothers to be their guardians. Thereupon they assumed the sovereignty of Asitañjana. From there they set out to conquer the whole of Jambudīpa，starting with Ayojjhā （whose king，Kālasena，they took prisoner） and Dvāravatī，which they captured with the help ofKanhadīpayana.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey made Dvāravatī their capital and divided their kingdom into ten shares，forgetting their sister，Añjanadevī. When they discovered their mistake，Ankura gave her his share and took to trade. Ankura’s later history is found in PvA.111ff. See Ankura.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn course of time the brothers had many sons and daughters，the average human age at that time being 20，000 years. Later their sons annoyed the sage Kanhadīpāyana by dressing up a lad as a woman and asking him what child she would bring forth. ”A knot of acacia wood，” he answered，”with which will be destroyed the line of Vasudeva.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey laughed at the sage and kicked him. On the seventh day the lad voided from his belly a knot of acacia wood which they burnt，casting the ashes into the river. From those ashes，which stuck near the city gate，an Eraka-plant sprang up. One day，while disporting themselves in the water，the kings，with their families and followers，started a sham quarrel and plucked leaves from the Eraka-plant to use as clubs. The leaves turned into weapons in their hands，and they were all killed except Vāsudeva，Baladeva，Añjanadevī，and their chaplain，all of whom fled in a chariot. Thus were the words of the sage fulfilled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn their flight they reached the Kālamattiya forest in which Mutthika had been born as a Yakkha. When Mutthika saw Baladeva he assumed the shape of a wrestler and challenged him to a fight. Baladeva accepted the challenge and ”was gobbled up like a radish-bulb.”\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVāsudeva proceeded on his way with the others and at night lay in a bush for shelter. A huntsman，mistaking him for a pig，speared him； when Vāsudeva heard that the huntsman’s name was Jarā （Old Age） he reconciled himself to death. Thus they all perished except Añjanadevī （J.iv.79ff），of whose later history nothing is mentioned.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Kumbha Jātaka （J.v. p.18） it is suggested that the Andhakavenhus were destroyed as a result of indulging in drink. This story was evidently well known to tradition as it is so often referred to. E.g.，in the Sankicca Jāt. （v. 267） and in Vv.，p.58."],["V","Andhakavenhu：Husband of Nandagopā，serving-woman of Devagabbhā. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ten sons of Devagabbhā by Upasāgara were brought up as the children of Nandagopā and Andhakavenhu and later became known as Andhakavenhudāsaputtā. J.iv.79-81."]]
