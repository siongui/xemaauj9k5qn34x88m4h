[["V","Ādittena Sutta：It were a good thing if the sense organs were seared with a red-hot iron，for then there would be no grasping of marks or details of objects cognizable by the senses. It were a good thing to be asleep，for then the mind would not be applied to evil ends. But it were better to ponder on the impermanence of the sense organs，their sensations，the consciousness and the contacts connected with them and all that has to do with the mind，because that pondering would produce repulsion and dispassion，freedom and realisation of freedom. S.iv.168f."]]
