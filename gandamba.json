[["V","Gandamba：The mango-tree，at the gate of Sāvatthi，under which the Buddha performed the Yamaka-pātihāriya．The king’s gardener，Ganda，while on his way to the palace to give the king a ripe mango-fruit from the palace gardens，saw the Buddha going on his alms-rounds and offered him the mango．The Buddha ate it immediately，and gave the seed to Ananda to be planted by the gardener at the city-gate．A tree of one hundred cubits sprouted forth at once，covered with fruit and flowers．At the foot of this tree Vissakamma，by the order ofSakka，built a pavilion of the seven kinds of precious things．J.iv.264f； J.i.88； DhA.iii.206ff； Mil.349."]]
